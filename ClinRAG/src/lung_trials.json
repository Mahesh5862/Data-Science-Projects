The prevalence of this syndrome ranges from 10% to 30% in people with chronic liver disease.\n\nThe exact cause of HPS is unknown. Previous research has shown that eicosanoids function as vasoconstrictors and cause an increase in the number of intravascular macrophage-like cells. Cirrhosis has been linked to increased NO generation in the lungs, which has been linked to intrapulmonary venous dilation. Increased pulmonary NO production is attributed to increased expression of pulmonary vascular endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase.\n\nIncreased hepatic synthesis and release of low levels of endothelin 1 (ET-1) has been established in recent investigations to function as a trigger for increasing eNO levels. TNF (tumor necrosis factor) and ET-1 have both been linked to the onset of experimental HPS. Increased CO generation and heme oxygenase expression have been linked to the progression of HPS in recent investigations. HPS increases mortality in cirrhotic patients and may affect the frequency and severity of portal hypertension consequences.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge there have been only three pilot studies in humans which checked the effect of pentoxifylline in hepatopulmonary syndrome and they showed highly contrasting results. The outcome was also measured in a short interval. Investigator hypothesize that pentoxifylline would improve the oxygenation in patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome","detailedDescription":"Hypothesis Investigator hypothesize that pentoxifylline in hepatopulmonary syndrome would improve oxygenation by inhibiting TNF alpha and thereby reducing macrophage, endothelium induced NO production compared to placebo\n\nAim To study efficacy of pentoxifylline in reducing AaPO2 in hepatopulmonary syndrome when compared to placebo\n\nMethodology:\n\nStudy design: Prospective double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial DATA and SPECIMEN collection Patient data, demographics, etiology of liver disease, PFT, abdominal radiological studies will be collected 6-minute walk test will be done at the baseline, 3 months, and 6 months Sampling for ABG will be performed with the subject seated while breathing room air at baseline and at the end of 3 and 6 months and A-aPO2 values will be calculated using Alveolar gas equation.\n\nTNF alpha levels, vWF, ET-1, VEGFR-3, iNOS, eNOS and IL-1 β levels will be measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.\n\nDLCO and exhaled NO will be measured at the baseline and at the end of 3 and 6 months Blinding The study drug and placebo will be administered in identical packaging and labelling to ensure that investigators and participants are blinded to study treatment. The study drug and placebo will be labelled with a unique label letter that will be used to allocate treatment to the patient, but the allocation will not be indicated to the investigators or participants. Except for the trial pharmacists and biostatistician, no member of the study team or their extended personnel will have access to the randomization method during the study's execution. The investigator will get the treatment assignment from trial pharmacists in the case of a medical emergency in which breaking the blind is necessary to give medical care to the participant.\n\nDEFINITION - Hepatopulmonary syndrome will be defined by\n\n1.

Eligible patients score \\>= 13 on the FCRI-SF and have completed their primary treatment i.e., surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy, for breast, ovarian, lung and prostate cancer at the participating departments between three weeks and three months previously.\n\nProcedure:\n\nPatients scheduled for a follow-up visit with the participating oncologists will receive a secure e-mail invitation to participate in the study and a link to a RedCap questionnaire. Patients willing to participate will provide their informed consent electronically and complete the 9-item FCRI-SF. Patients scoring \\>= 13 are provided with additional information about the study and asked for their consent to participate.\n\nOne week before the planned follow-up consultation, they will be asked to complete a RedCap baseline questionnaire (T1). One week and three months after the consultation, the patients will be asked to complete the RedCap post-intervention (T2) and follow-up questionnaires (T3).\n\nOncologists will complete a RedCap baseline questionnaire assessing age, gender, years of experience, and self-efficacy in managing patient FCR. Oncologists will then be allocated to the intervention or active control arm using a stratified randomization sequence generated by the Aarhus University clinical trial unit ensuring a balanced allocation of oncologists according to the cancer type treated. Oncologists will then receive a link to online CIFeR training and report their post-training self-efficacy for managing patient FCR. During the consultation, the oncologist will deliver the CIFeR intervention and complete a brief 5-item checklist on whether they delivered all five components and, if not, why. After including all patients, the oncologist is asked to complete a follow-up RedCap questionnaire on self-efficacy in managing patient FCR.\n\nThe CIFeR intervention:\n\nThe intervention includes five components informed by theoretical models and existing interventions for FCR: 1) FCR normalization: reassurance that FCR is a common and normal phenomenon after treatment for cancer, 2) Providing prognostic information: asking patients whether they would like information about their risk of recurrence and, if yes, providing this information, 3) Providing education and take-home information on red-flag recurrence symptoms, 4) Brief advice on managing worry: distraction, meditation, mindfulness, reassurance, and links to online resources to manage FCR, and 5) referral to a psychologist if FCR is high (FCRI-SF \\>= 22), or if deemed helpful by the patient or clinician. Access will be provided to ConquerFear-Group delivered online by trained psycho-oncologists.\n\nOutcome measures:\n\nPatients:\n\nThe primary outcome is the change in FCR, assessed with the 9-item Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Short Form (FCRI-SF). Secondary outcomes include a) anxiety and depression assessed with the The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), b) patient reported intervention usefulness assessed with the Patient Centered Communication Scale (PCC), c) metacognition assessed with the metacognitions questionnaire (MCQ-30), d) unmet needs assessed with Subscale of the Survivors Unmet Need Survey (SUNS-8), e) rumination assessed with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), and f) General Quality of Life (QoL) assessed with the EQ-5D for later use in cost-effectiveness analysis. All measures will be completed at all three time-points (T1-T3).\n\nAt six months, the investigators will ask a subset of 15-20 patients to participate in a semi-structured phone interview about their experience with the intervention.\n\nOncologists:\n\nOncologists complete a general item on self-efficacy in managing patient FCR together with the 27-item Self-efficacy in Patient-Centeredness Questionnaire (SEPCQ-27) at baseline, post-training (only oncologists in the intervention group), and after completed inclusion. Based on a suggested framework for implementation outcomes, the investigators will assess with 11-point scales: 1) acceptability, 2) appropriateness, 3) feasibility, together with 4) fidelity, measured as the average number of components oncologists report having delivered to patients, and 5) sustainability measured as the proportion of oncologists in the intervention group who report having used CIFeR at least once within the last three months, measured six months after completed inclusion. Six months after the inclusion of their last patient, all oncologists will be asked to participate in a semi-structured interview and provide feedback on the CIFeR-training and their experiences with the intervention, including perceived utility and the perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing CIFeR in routine care.

Allogeneic adoptive cell therapy is a treatment where immune cells from a healthy donor are given to a cancer patient, usually to help prevent or treat cancer relapse after a stem cell transplant. These donor cells can either be directly infused into the patient or grown in a lab to create more specialized immune cells that target and kill cancer. While this therapy has been helpful for many patients, there is a need to make it more effective for a larger group and reduce side effects like graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), where the donor's immune cells attack the patient's healthy tissue.\n\nThis Early Phase 1 trial will test whether exercise can help produce better immune cells from donors. The investigators will recruit healthy participants for three study groups:\n\n1. Exercise Group: Participants will complete a 20-minute cycling exercise session. The investigators will collect blood samples before, during, and after exercise to study the number and quality of immune cells. The investigators will also use the collected cells to create immune therapies and test their ability to kill cancer cells in the lab and control cancer growth in mice.\n2. Exercise and Beta Blocker Group: In this group, participants will complete up to five cycling sessions, with at least a week between each session. Before each session, participants will take either a placebo or a drug (beta blocker) that blocks stress hormones like adrenaline. The investigators will collect blood samples before and during exercise to see how blocking these hormones changes the effect of exercise on immune cells.\n3. Isoproterenol Group: Participants in this group will receive a 20-minute infusion of isoproterenol, a drug that mimics the effects of adrenaline. The investigators will collect blood samples before, during, and after the infusion to see if the drug causes similar immune changes to those caused by exercise.\n\nParticipants can join one, two, or all three groups. This research will help understand whether exercise can improve immune cell therapies for treating blood cancer and reduce the risk of GvHD, making these treatments safer and more effective.","detailedDescription":"Background:\n\nAllogeneic cell therapies encompass various approaches, including donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) and engineered immune cell products like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, gamma delta (γδ) T-cells, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, and cytokine-induced memory-like natural killer (NK) cells. These therapies are commonly employed after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) to prevent or treat leukemic relapse in high-risk patients. However, while these therapies have shown potential, the success rates for DLI and expanded cell products remain limited. DLI, in particular, carries the risk of inducing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), where donor T-cells attack healthy tissues, leading to significant morbidity. Furthermore, expanded cell products face challenges related to manufacturing times, efficacy, and cost, which can limit their accessibility and effectiveness. Therefore, there is a critical need to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GvL) effects of DLI and improve the efficacy of expanded cell products to achieve better outcomes for a larger number of patients without increasing the risk of GvHD, thereby broadening their use in clinical practice.\n\nExercise has been shown to contribute to lower cancer risk, improve outcomes in cancer survivors, and act as an adjuvant for several cancer therapies. The present exercise model involves an acute single bout of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise lasting 20 minutes, which evokes a catecholamine-dependent mobilization and redistribution of effector lymphocytes (e.g., natural killer cells, γδ T-cells, and CD8+ T-cells). This response may enhance long-term immunosurveillance by improving the recognition and destruction of premalignant cells and contributing to the suppression of tumor growth. The overarching research question is: Can lymphocytes be collected from blood during the exercise-induced mobilization phase to generate superior cell products for cancer immunotherapy? The overall vision is to develop exercise-mobilized lymphocytes into a therapy that increases the efficacy of both DLI and expanded cell products (e.g., CAR T-cells, γδ T-cells, CIK cells, and cytokine-induced memory-like NK cells) for treating leukemia/lymphoma relapse. This novel approach, termed \"DLI-X,\" has the potential to improve a pre-existing therapy for the treatment of blood cancers at minimal cost.\n\nThe goals of this proposal are to conduct head-to-head comparisons between standard DLI and DLI-X, both in vitro and in xenogeneic mouse models engrafted with various human hematological cancers, and to identify the underlying mechanisms driving the enhanced anti-leukemia/lymphoma response of DLI-X.\n\nThe overarching hypothesis is that DLI-X and the expanded cell products manufactured from these exercise-mobilized lymphocytes will exhibit enhanced GvL effects against multiple hematological malignancies compared to standard DLI. These effects will be driven by β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR)-mediated transcriptomic and proteomic changes that promote target cell recognition and cytotoxicity. Additionally, it is proposed that DLI-X will improve the efficacy of combination therapies such as blinatumomab, a bi-specific T-cell engager, and monoclonal antibodies designed to increase antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), thereby enhancing tumor growth suppression and the GvL effects of DLI.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\n1. Evaluate how acute, single bouts of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise lasting 20 minutes influence the number, phenotype, and molecular characteristics of immune cells in the blood.\n2. Determine whether immune cells collected post-exercise yield superior therapeutic products compared to those collected under resting conditions from the same donor.\n3. Investigate the role of adrenergic receptor signaling in mediating these effects\n\nProcedures:\n\nHealthy participants will be recruited into three distinct arms (cohorts) of this study: (1) Exercise Cohort; (2) Exercise + Beta Blocker Cohort; and/or (3) Isoproterenol Infusion Cohort. Participants may enroll in one, two, or all three study arms. The procedures for each cohort are outlined below.\n\nExercise Cohort Participants in the Exercise Cohort will be scheduled to visit the laboratory for three separate sessions between 08:00 and 10:00. During each visit, staff will confirm adherence to pre-testing guidelines (e.g., 8-12 hours of fasting and no vigorous physical activity). Any participant who does not meet these guidelines will be rescheduled.\n\nExercise Cohort Visit 1: Screening and Graded Exercise Test Time Commitment: 60 minutes\n\n1. Informed Consent: A member of the research team will obtain written informed consent from the participant.\n2. Pre-screening Questionnaire: Participants will complete the AHA/ACSM pre-screening questionnaire to verify that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.\n3. Anthropometric Measurements: Height and weight will be measured.\n4. Blood Samples: A fingerstick capillary blood sample will be collected (using a sterile spring-loaded lancet) for total cholesterol and fasting glucose quantification, using an automated handheld analyzer (Cardiocheck).\n5. Blood Pressure Measurement: Resting blood pressure will be measured using a manual or automated blood pressure cuff.\n6. Risk Stratification: Participants deemed ineligible after screening will be excluded from further participation.\n7. Graded Exercise Test: Participants will perform a maximal exercise protocol on an indoor stationary bicycle. They will wear a heart rate monitor and a face mask connected to a metabolic cart for continuous measurement of heart rate and respiratory gases. The test will begin at 50 Watts for females and 75 Watts for males, with power increased by 15 Watts each minute until exhaustion. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), ventilatory threshold, and peak cycling power will be determined.\n\nExercise Cohort Visits 2 and 3 Time Commitment: 2 hours per visit Participants will return to the laboratory 3-10 days after Visit 1 and 7-14 days after Visit 2.\n\n1. Pre-Exercise Procedures: An IV catheter will be inserted into a peripheral arm vein by a trained phlebotomist. A pre-exercise blood sample (approximately 120 mL) will be collected.\n2. Exercise Protocol: Participants will engage in a 20-minute session of moderate-to-vigorous cycling exercise at power outputs corresponding to 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% of their predetermined maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) for 5-minute increments. Participants will not be exercised to exhaustion during these trials. Blood pressure measurements and ratings of perceived exertion will be collected every 5 minutes during the exercise session and immediately after.\n3. Blood Sampling During Exercise: Additional venous blood samples (total volume during exercise: 80 mL) will be collected through the IV catheter at various stages of the exercise protocol.\n4. Post-Exercise Blood Draw: A final blood draw of 15 mL will be collected 1 hour post-exercise.\n\nTotal Blood Volume: Participants will donate a total of 215 mL of blood (120 mL pre-exercise, 80 mL during exercise, and 15 mL post-exercise) per visit, for a total of 430ml across both visits. Additionally, several droplets of capillary blood (approximately 10-20 µL) will be collected during Visit 1 for screening purposes.\n\nThe procedures for Visits 2 and 3 will be identical. The rationale for two visits is to obtain sufficient blood to generate multiple therapeutic cell products from the same donor. The total time commitment for this cohort is approximately 5 hours.\n\nExercise + Beta Blocker Cohort\n\nTime Commitment: 21 hours Participants in the Exercise + Beta Blocker Cohort will be scheduled to visit the laboratory for six separate sessions between 08:00 and 10:00, which will be spread over 6-10 weeks. During each visit, study staff will confirm adherence to pre-testing guidelines (e.g., 8-12 hours of fasting and no vigorous physical activity). Any participant who does not meet these guidelines will be rescheduled.\n\nExercise + Beta Blocker Cohort Visit 1 - Graded Exercise Test Time Commitment: 60 minutes. Participants will complete a graded exercise test on an indoor stationary bicycle to determine their maximal oxygen uptake (VO₂max) and peak cycling power. This test will ensure the appropriate intensity levels for subsequent exercise trials.\n\nExercise + Beta Blocker Cohort Visits 2-6 - Exercise Trials Time Commitment: 20 hours\n\nThe remaining five visits will consist of the main exercise trials, where participants will undergo the following procedures. There will be a 7-10 day period between each exercise trial visit to allow for recovery and minimize potential carryover effects from the drugs administered:\n\n1. Drug Administration: The drug trials will be conducted in a block, randomized double-blind setting to ensure that neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which trial is occurring. The randomization will be computed by a member of the research team not involved in performing the exercise trials. The timing of drug administration is based on peak plasma concentrations of each drug. At 3 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour prior to each exercise trial, participants will be administered either a drug or a placebo pill according to the following outline:\n\n   Trial 1: Placebo at all time points Trial 2: Nadolol at 3 hours Placebo at 2 hours and 1 hour Trial 3: Bisoprolol at 3 hours Placebo at 2 hours and 1 hour Trial 4: Placebo at 3 hours and 1 hour, Carvedilol at 2 hours Trial 5: Bisoprolol at 3 hours, Placebo at 2 hours, Roflumilast at 1 hour\n2. Pre-Drug Procedures: Prior to the ingestion of the drug or placebo, an IV catheter will be inserted into a peripheral arm vein by a trained phlebotomist. A pre-drug blood sample will be collected.\n3. Post-Drug, Pre-Exercise Blood Sample: After the drug or placebo has been ingested and 30 minutes before exercise begins, a post-drug, pre-exercise blood sample will be collected.\n4. Exercise Protocol: Participants will engage in a 20-minute session of moderate-to-vigorous cycling exercise at power outputs corresponding to 50%, 60%, 70%, and 80% of their predetermined VO₂max for 5-minute increments. Participants will not be exercised to exhaustion during these trials. Blood pressure measurements and ratings of perceived exertion will be collected every 5 minutes during the exercise session and immediately after.\n5. Blood Sampling During Exercise: Additional venous blood samples will be collected through the IV catheter at various time points throughout the exercise protocol.\n6. Post-Exercise Recovery Blood Samples: Additional blood samples will be collected during the recovery phase, at various time points ranging from 5 to 60 minutes post-exercise.\n\nTotal Blood Volume: Participants in this cohort will donate a total of approximately 220 mL of blood per visit. The cumulative total blood volume for this cohort across all six visits is approximately 1,320 mL.\n\nIsoproterenol Cohort Participants in the Isoproterenol Cohort will be scheduled to visit the laboratory for three separate sessions between 08:00 and 10:00. During each visit, study staff will confirm adherence to pre-testing guidelines (e.g., 8-12 hours of fasting and no vigorous physical activity). Any participant who does not meet these guidelines will be rescheduled.\n\nIsoproterenol Cohort Visit 1: Screening and Isoproterenol Infusion Time Commitment: 2 hours\n\n1. Informed Consent: A member of the research team will obtain written informed consent from the participant.\n2. Pre-screening Questionnaire: Participants will complete the AHA/ACSM pre-screening questionnaire to verify that inclusion and exclusion criteria are met.\n3. Anthropometric Measurements: Height and weight will be measured.\n4. Blood Samples: A fingerstick capillary blood sample will be collected (using a sterile spring-loaded lancet) for total cholesterol and fasting glucose quantification, using an automated handheld analyzer (Cardiocheck).\n5. Blood Pressure Measurement: Resting blood pressure will be measured using a manual or automated blood pressure cuff.\n6. Risk Stratification: Participants deemed ineligible after screening will be excluded from further participation.\n7. Pre-Infusion Procedures: The participant will be fitted with electrodes attached to an electrocardiogram (ECG; 12-lead) and will receive a resting ECG reading, which will be monitored by a physician cardiologist. The cardiologist will make the decision whether to proceed with the infusion or exclude the participant from the study. Two IV catheters will be inserted into bilateral peripheral arm veins by a trained phlebotomist. One catheter will be used for delivering isoproterenol, and one will be used for collecting blood samples. A pre-infusion blood sample (approximately 120 mL) will be collected.\n8. Isoproterenol Infusion Protocol: Participants will receive a continuous infusion of isoproterenol for 20-minutes at a concentration of 50ng/min/kg. Blood pressure measurements will be collected every 5 minutes during the infusion and ECG activity will be monitored continuously. A physician cardiologist will monitor the entire infusion procedure.\n9. Blood Sampling During Infusion: Additional venous blood samples (total volume during exercise: 80 mL) will be collected through the IV catheter during the last 5-minutes of the infusion protocol.\n10. Post-Infusion Blood Draw: A final blood draw of 15 mL will be collected 1 hour post-exercise.\n\nTotal Blood Volume: Participants will donate a total of 215 mL of blood (120 mL pre-infusion, 80 mL during infusion, and 15 mL post-infusion) during this visit. Additionally, several droplets of capillary blood (approximately 10-20 µL) will be collected during Visit 1 for screening purposes.\n\nOutcome Measures:\n\nThe outcome measures for all three cohorts will be identical as described in the 'Outcome Measures' section of this protocol"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Leukemia","Hematopoetic Stem Cell Transplantation","Donor Lymphocyte Infusion","CAR T-Cell Therapy","Lymphoma","Cell Therapy"],"keywords":["exercise","cell therapy","beta-blockers","immune function","phosphodiesterase inhibitor","CAR T-cells","NK-cells","cytokine-induced killer cells","cytokine-induced memory-like NK-cells","monoclonal antibodies","leukemia","lymphoma","donor lymphocyte infusion","gamma-delta T-cells"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["EARLY_PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"This trial has two main approaches:\n\n1.

Preclinical studies have shown that volatile anesthetics might suppress host immunity and promote a pro-malignant environment which supports cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, whereas propofol may preserve cell-mediated immunity and inhibits tumor angiogenesis. However, clinical evidence that propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) can reduce tumor recurrence after curative resection remains inconsistent due to retrospective observational nature of previous studies. Therefore, the investigators will test the hypothesis that the recurrence free survival (RFS) after curative resection of NSCLC is higher in patient who received TIVA than volatile anesthetics in this multi-center randomized trials.\n\nThis double-blind, randomized trial will enroll patients at 22 international sites, subject to study registration, institutional review board approval, and patient written informed consent. Eligible patients are adult patients undergoing lung resection surgery with curative intent for NSCLC. At each study site, enrolled subjects will be randomly allocated into the TIVA and GAS group with a 1:1 ratio. A centralized, password-protected, and encrypted web-based electronic case report form will be used for randomization and data upload. This pragmatic trial does not standardize any aspect of patient care. However, potential confounders will be balanced between the study arms.\n\nThe primary outcome will be recurrence free survival (RFS). Secondary outcomes will be overall survival and complications within postoperative 7 days. Enrollment of 5384 patients will provide 80% power to detect a 3% treatment effect (hazard ratio of 0.83) at alpha 0.05 for RFS at 3 years.\n\nConfirmation of the study hypothesis would demonstrate that a relatively minor and low cost alteration in anesthetic management has the potential to reduce cancer recurrence risk in NSCLC, an ultimately fatal complication. Rejection of the hypothesis would end the ongoing debate about the relationship between cancer recurrence and anesthetic management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Surgery","Anesthesia"],"keywords":["Anesthesia","Desflurane","Inhalational anesthesia","Isoflurane","Lung neoplasm","Metastasis","Propofol","Recurrence","Sevoflurane","Surgery","Non-small cell lung cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE4"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"PREVENTION","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":5384,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"TIVA group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"The TIVA group will receive propofol for both induction and maintenance of general anesthesia.","interventionNames":["Drug: Propofol"]},{"label":"GAS group","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"The GAS group will receive one or more volatile anesthetics (sevoflurane, desflurane, or isoflurane) for induction and maintenance of anesthesia during the surgery.

Using a 3D printer, a model is made based on the patient's anthropometric data.\n\nManufacturing takes place by 3D printing on a titanium alloy powder certified for the manufacture of medical implants. The technology used is a type of SLS (Selective Laser Sintering) -technology, layer-by-layer laser melting of metal-powder compositions. The printing process begins with dividing the digital 3D model of the product into layers with a thickness of 20 to 100 microns in order to create a 2D image of each layer of the product (section). The industry standard format is STL (Stereolithography) file. This file enters a special machine software, where the information is analyzed and compared with the technical capabilities of the machine. Based on the data obtained, a production cycle of construction is launched, consisting of many cycles of building individual layers of the product.\n\nThe cycle for constructing a layer (section) consists of typical operations:\n\n* applying a layer of powder of a given thickness to the construction plate;\n* scanning by a laser beam of the section of the product layer. The laser beam is a source of heat, under the influence of which the particles of the material are sintered along the profile of the section of the model;\n* lowering the platform into the depth of the construction well by an amount corresponding to the thickness of the construction layer.\n\nThe process of building products takes place in the SLM (Selective Laser Melting) chamber of the machine, filled with an inert gas argon. After construction, the product is removed from the printer chamber and sent for heat treatment, annealing, to relieve internal stresses and improve mechanical properties. After annealing, the product is separated from the platform and undergoes finishing, which combines various types of machining. The final stages of the technological process are product cleaning and technical quality control.\n\nPreoperative preparation takes an average of 14-21 days. The next stage is surgical treatment in the amount of resection of the chest wall with plastic defect with an individual titanium implant. In all cases, the titanium framework is separated from the pleural cavity by a synthetic polyester (Dacron) plate in order to seal and prevent the development of pulmonary hernias. The advantages of titanium individual implants include accurate matching of the implant to the size and characteristics of the defect, individual modeling allows you to repeat the anatomical features of the patient. This method helps to recreate the original shape of the chest, and most importantly, symmetrical, relatively healthy half.

These mutations are screened using the Oncomine Focus Assay, where 52 genetic alterations - including hotspots, single nucleotide variants, indels, CNVs, and gene fusions - may be detected in a single workflow. Oncomine™ Comprehensive Assay v3, an NGS assay which tests for 161 unique genes (Appendix IV), will be used in a later stage of the study, allowing for broader coverage of potentially targetable alterations. Both assays have a rapid turnaround time and addresses one of the main challenges of solid tumor testing - the scarcity of tissue material - requiring minimal sample input and thus enabling the use of a wider range of sample quality and types, including small biopsies and fine needle aspirates. However, as the list of therapeutically relevant biomarkers continues to expand over time, broader NGS panels will be used subsequently to incorporate emerging alterations. In addition, relevant baseline clinical characteristics are collated e.g. patient demographics, smoking history, number of lines of therapy, as well as outcomes including access to targeted therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and overall survival. Through comprehensive annotation of clinical-pathological-molecular characteristics, this study will provide a means to rationalize the application of diagnostic tests, as well as identify prognostic and predictive factors in the treatment of Asian lung cancers."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer","Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer"],"keywords":["Oncomine Focus Panel Assay","Molecular

Double-lumen endotracheal(DLT) intubation is still the most reliable way of intubation in lung surgery. However, hypoxemia faced during double-lumen intubation still threatens the perioperative safety of thoracic surgery patients. In recent years, high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) has great potential in the field of anesthesia, especially playing a new and important role in the prevention and treatment of short-term hypoxia and life-threatening airway emergencies. However, the use of HFNO in pulmonary surgery patients with poor pulmonary function lacks evidence-based basis, and there are few reliable clinical data.\n\nThis study adopted a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind design. A total of 100 patients aged 18-60 years who underwent elective thoracoscopy-assisted pulmonary surgery were included and randomly divided into the experimental group: HFNO was used in the process of double-lumen intubation asphyxia; the control group: according to the traditional intubation process, No oxygen therapy equipment was used during intubation asphyxiation. The lowest blood oxygen saturation during intubation, the incidence of hypoxemia during intubation, perioperative complications, and postoperative hospital stay were compared between the two groups.\n\nThis study explores the advantages of HFNO in complex endotracheal intubation, assuming that HFNO can improve the oxygen saturation of double-lumen intubation; optimize the intubation method of DLT, and tap its new potential to prevent and manage emergency airway crisis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Neoplasms","Pneumothorax"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"TRIPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":112,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"HFNO group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Direct guidance and positioning of DLT intubation with FOB visualization, using HFNO during intubation asphyxia.","interventionNames":["Device: HFNO"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"NO_INTERVENTION","description":"The DLT cannula was directly guided and positioned under FOB visualization, and no oxygen therapy equipment was used during intubation."}],"interventions":[{"type":"DEVICE","name":"HFNO","description":"After the patient's mask-assisted ventilation makes the end-expiratory oxygen concentration (EtO2) \\> 90%, wear the HFNO device according to the pre-adjusted mode (temperature 34°C, oxygen concentration 100%, flow rate 50 litres per minute).

Previous studies show that apoptosis escape can lead to EGFR-TKI resistance.Osimertinib resistant cells show abnormal activation of PI3K/AKT/BIM activation(PMID 28765329). The classical drug aspirin can effectively decrease AKT phosphorylation and activate of BIM(PMID 28881293).So Investigators speculate that aspirin may decrease the PI3K/AKT/BIM signaling pathways, then promote osimertinib resistant cells apoptosis. The current study aims to evaluate the combination of aspirin and osimertinib in patients with EGFR/T790M mutations.","detailedDescription":"Reversible small-molecule EGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) have shown dramatic therapeutic efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-activating mutations, and have been recommended as the standard first-line therapy in these patients. However, despite excellent initial clinical responses, nearly all patients eventually develop drug resistance after a median period of about 10 months(PMID 26497205). Osimertinib is a 3rd-generation EGFR-TKI used to treat NSCLC patients with resistance to 1st generation EGFR-TKI due to T790M mutation. But Osimertinib also face the problem of acquired drug-resistance(PMID 27959700). Thus, innovative treatment strategies are urgently needed to overcome therapeutic resistance to Osimertinib to improve the survival of patients with NSCLC.\n\nMolecular mechanisms underlying acquired Osimertinib resistance are still not fully understood. Previous study showed that one principal mechanism accounting for majority of acquired resistance to Osimertinib in lung cancer is mediated by an exon 20 C797S mutation etc(PMID 29596911). More molecular mechanisms are still to be found. Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and global mRNA decay. Apoptosis has been found to be related to drug resistance to 1st generation EGFR-TKI(PMID 29731879). The investigators previous found apoptosis is also related to Osimertinib resistance(PMID 28765329). Therefore, promoting apoptosis may be an effective way to improve the response to Osimertinib treatment.\n\nInvestigators' group has focused on lung cancer targeted therapy for several years. Previously, investigators have reported that metformin in combination with 1st generation EGFR-TKI could enhance the effect of TKI (PMID 24644001). Therefore, investigators further asked whether the drug combination approach could overcome osimertinib resistance. Aspirin is a widely used and well-tolerated drug for Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic and has arisen keen interest as a potential anticancer agent ever since the report of the clinical evidence that the cancer risk and mortality are reduced in Colon cancer. Aspirin exerts remarkable antitumor properties in tumor cells and mouse models. It strongly inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells, and its combination with TKI agents, including Sorafenib (PMID: 28857200), significantly suppressed RAS-mutant cancers growth and prolonged remission in a xenograft model. Interestingly, Aspirin exposure significantly promoted the apoptosis suggesting that aspirin may overcome Osimertinib resistance by promoting the apoptosis.\n\nHere, investigators'group observed that in clinic, several patients who took osimertinib and aspirin together have shown excellent effect.Investigators therefore conduct this clinical trial to observe whether the combination of Aspirin and Osimertinib could enhance efficacy of Osimertinib in lung cancer patients resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKI with T790M."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IIIB","Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Stage IV","EGFR T790M"],"keywords":["lung cancer","Aspirin","Osimertinib","EGFR-TKI","resistance"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":100,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"osimertinib and aspirin","description":"Osimertinib and Aspirin starting at a dose of 80 mg and 100mg once a day, orally with meals.

Vitamin E acts primarily as an anti-oxidant. By decreasing the oxidation in the cancer cell, the tumor cells may die. Vitamin E is a commonly used vitamin that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in this type of cancer or for any known cancer. This study will test the hypothesis that vitamin E, in the setting of an oxidative stress such as smoking, can reduce prostate cancer related biomarkers in patients with localized prostate cancer in the neoadjuvant setting.","detailedDescription":"\\- Prostate Cancer\n\nProstate cancer is the most common malignancy in American men. It was estimated that nearly 235,000 men in the United States would be diagnosed with prostate cancer and nearly 27,000 men would die. The treatment of localized prostate cancer includes surgery, radiation therapy, or watchful waiting. The relative benefits of these approaches is unclear and treatment choices are individualized and often patient driven. There is currently no proven benefit to receiving preoperative hormonal therapy for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. As opposed to patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy, for patients undergoing brachytherapy pre treatment hormonal therapy is used in approximately 40% of patients. Thus, these patients offer a unique opportunity to test novel agents in the neoadjuvant setting.\n\n\\- Vitamin E\n\nThe term vitamin E was introduced by Evans and Bishop to describe a dietary factor important for reproduction in rats. Natural vitamin E includes two groups of closely related fat-soluble compounds, the tocopherols and tocotrienols. Eight analogous compounds are widely distributed in nature. Rich, natural sources of vitamin E are edible plant oils. Distinct biological effects of different forms of vitamin E can be distinguished at a molecular level. Vitamin E is the major hydrophobic chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free radical reactions in the lipid components of membranes, vacuoles and plasma lipoproteins.\n\nAs an antioxidant, vitamin E acts in cell membranes where it prevents the propagation of free radical reactions. Non-radical oxidation products are formed by the reaction between alpha-tocopheryl radical and other free radicals, which are conjugated to glucuronic acid and excreted through the bile or urine. Vitamin E is transported in plasma lipoproteins.\n\nMost studies of the safety of vitamin E supplementation have lasted for several months or less, so there is little evidence for the long-term safety of vitamin E supplementation. The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has set an upper tolerable intake level (UL) for vitamin E at 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) for any form of supplementary alpha-tocopherol per day. Based for the most part on the result of animal studies, the Food and Nutrition Board decided that because vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant and may increase the risk of bleeding problems this is the highest dose unlikely to result in bleeding problems (http://dietary-supplements.info.nih.gov/factsheets/vitamin.asp).\n\nThe dose of vitamin E used in the Selenium and vitamin E prostate cancer prevention trial (the SELECT trial) was 400 IU per day and thus this is the dose chosen for this study."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Prostate Cancer"],"keywords":["Vitamin E","Prostate Cancer","Alpha-tocopherol (α-tocopherol)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Arm 1 (Vitamin E)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Vitamin E","interventionNames":["Drug: Vitamin E"]},{"label":"Arm 2","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Placebo (same vehicle as used for vitamin E)","interventionNames":["Drug: Vitamin E"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Vitamin E","description":"Patients will take one 400 IU tablet of vitamin E or a placebo daily.

This therapy utilizes biotechnology to culture the immune cells of cancer patients in vitro and then re-infuse them back into the body, stimulating and enhancing the body's own immune function, killing and inhibiting cancer cells, eliminating small and residual lesions, or achieving the goal of treating cancer by significantly inhibiting the proliferation of residual cancer cells.","detailedDescription":"This project focuses on the DC autologous immunocyte therapy based on the core technology of screening tumor antigen dominant CTL epitope peptides through independent patent technology. It is a cutting-edge research direction in the field of tumor immunotherapy in recent years. The non-engineered DC cells induced by special induction techniques can effectively overcome the shortcomings of the poor therapeutic effect of engineered gene editing technology on solid tumors, and effectively achieve targeted killing of tumors. The DC-CIK immunocyte therapy adopted in this project utilizes the original discovery of HLA-A molecule-restricted tumor-related antigen CTL epitope peptides to modify DC. On the one hand, through subcutaneous injection in vivo, it induces CD8+ T cells to produce CTL with memory function to play a role in eliminating and monitoring the protein with high expression of the tumor antigen source. On the other hand, it induces CD8+ T cells to produce CTL with memory function in vitro, and directly reinfuses CTL to exert the role of eliminating and monitoring the protein with high expression of the tumor antigen source. In the previous experimental studies, the CTL induced by G22 antigen-loaded DC has shown significant \"identification\" and targeted \"killing\" capabilities against various solid tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells isolated from tumor tissues. In animal experiments, it also shows the ability to induce the body to produce a strong immune response against various solid tumors such as breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, significantly inhibiting tumor growth, prolonging progression-free survival, and showing no obvious toxic side effects, having a promising application prospect. It has high individualization: customized based on the tumor mutation spectrum of patients, avoiding \"off-target\" damage to normal tissues. It has high safety: clinical studies have shown that the side effects are mild, mainly including injection site reactions or transient fever 37. Combined treatment potential: it can be used in combination with PD-1 inhibitors, chemotherapy or radiotherapy to enhance efficacy.\n\nAt present, self-active immune cell therapy based on tumor antigen-specific CTL epitope peptides has achieved significant progress in both research and clinical application in China. Personalized tumor vaccines, targeted immunoregulatory strategies for the tumor microenvironment, and combination treatment strategies are providing new concepts and methods for tumor therapy. In summary, the \"Clinical Research on Safety and Effectiveness of Autologous Immune Cell Therapy for Advanced Solid Tumors\" is expected to provide a clinical trial basis for the development of safe and effective clinical immunotherapies for patients with solid tumors."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer (Locally Advanced or Metastatic)","Liver Cancer (Locally Advanced or Metastatic)","Colorectal Cancer (Locally Advanced or Metastatic)","Breast Cancer (Locally Advanced or Metastatic)","Advanced Solid Tumors"],"keywords":["Advanced Solid Tumors","Metastatic Lung Cancer","Metastatic Liver Cancer","Metastatic Colorectal Cancer","Metastatic Breast Cancer","Autologous Immune Cell Therapy","Dendritic Cell Vaccine","CIK Cells","NK Cells"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"This study employs a sequential, two-phase design that incorporates both non-randomized and randomized components:\n\nPhase I (Safety Lead-in): This initial phase is a non-randomized, biomarker-directed study.

PET/CT uses a radioactive glutamate (one of the common building blocks of protein) called 18F-FSPG which may be able to recognize differences between tumor and healthy tissue. Since tumor cells are growing, they need to make protein, and other building blocks, for cell growth that are made from glutamate and other molecules. PET/CT using a radioactive glutamate may be a more effective method of diagnosing lung cancer than the standard PET/CT using a radioactive glucose (sugar), such as 18F-FDG.","detailedDescription":"PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

Despite strong intuitive appeal of the TM concept and over 150 studies of interventions implemented in a TM, there has been little investigation of the influence of TMs for smoking, particularly for promoting smoking cessation among those indirectly affected by a TM (e.g., relatives of cancer patients). This prospective observational study using a matched-group design will assess whether a lung cancer diagnosis increases enrollment in a smoking cessation program and cessation, and reduces smoking, among the patient's relatives/spouse who smoke. We will compare enrollment in a cessation program and cessation and smoking rates in 2 groups of smokers: 1) relatives/spouses of newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients, and 2) relatives/spouses of patients with an orthopedic condition. We will also explore mediators and moderators of a lung cancer diagnosis as a TM. This study could clarify the TM concept for smoking cessation, shed light on the underlying mechanisms of TMs, and guide future development and implementation of TM-based smoking cessation interventions."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Nicotine Dependence"],"keywords":["smoking","teachable moment","cancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"CASE_CONTROL","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":234,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1","description":"Relatives of Cancer Patients","interventionNames":["Drug: Transdermal nicotine patch"]},{"label":"2","description":"Relatives of Orthopedic Patients","interventionNames":["Drug: Transdermal nicotine patch"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Transdermal nicotine patch","description":"8 weeks; 4 weeks of 21mg, 2 weeks of 14mg, and 2 weeks of 7mg.","armGroupLabels":["1","2"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Accrual Rate (Eligibility Visit)","description":"Show rate to eligibility visit","timeFrame":"week zero"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Smoking Cessation Rate","timeFrame":"week nine"},{"measure":"Show Rate at First Treatment Session","timeFrame":"week one"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

However, a substantial portion of lung nodules was not located in the outer third, but the middle third of the lung field.

In addition, early signs of efficacy during treatment with CAN04 will be investigated.","detailedDescription":"CAN04 is a first-in-class fully humanized and ADCC enhanced monoclonal antibody, targeting the Interleukin 1 Receptor Accessory Protein (IL1RAP).\n\nThe CAN04 strategy is to attack the IL1RAP target molecule using an effective antibody-based cancer treatment. In preclinical (in vitro and in vivo) studies, CAN04 has shown two distinct mechanisms of action:\n\n1. By blocking the intracellular signals from the IL1RAP target molecule, thereby impairing the cancer cells' ability to secrete tumor stimulating cytokines, in turn reducing tumor inflammation and tumor progression.\n2. Through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against IL1RAP expressing tumor cells where CAN04 stimulates natural killer (NK) cells to attack the tumor cells.\n\nThe study is a combined phase 1/2a, open-label, dose-escalation followed by dose expansion, safety and tolerability clinical trial, in patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. It consists of two parts.\n\nIn Part I (Dose Escalation - DE), the intention is to include patients with any of the four solid tumor types: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or Colorectal Cancer (CRC). In this part of the study safety and tolerability will be documented and the MTD/ RP2D will be determined. Patients will stay on CAN04 treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason. \\[Completed December 2018\\]\n\nIn Part II (Expansion Cohort - EC), safety and tolerability will be further evaluated in an expanded cohort of subjects with PDAC or NSCLC to identify RP2D of CAN04 in combination with standard of care. In addition, early signs of efficacy during treatment with CAN04 will be investigated, as monotherapy or in combination with the standard of care.\n\nPatients will stay on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or discontinuation for any other reason. \\[Enrollment to all arms completed\\]"},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non Small Cell Lung Cancer","Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma","Triple Negative Breast Cancer","Colorectal Cancer"],"keywords":["First-in-Human","Phase 1","Phase 2","Antibody, Monoclonal","IL1RAP","Safety","Tolerability","Cancer","Solid tumor","Malignant","Dose escalation","Dose expansion","CAN04","Immunoglobulin","Clinical Trial","Infusion","Antineoplastic","Anticancer"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Part I of the study is designed to define the Maximum Tolerated Dose/ Recommended Phase 2 Dose (MTD/RP2D) of CAN04 in subjects with relapsed or refractory Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or Colorectal Cancer (CRC). \\[Completed December 2018\\]\n\nPart II consists of seven treatment arms and aims to establish the safety and tolerability of CAN04 as monotherapy and in combination with the standard of care in subjects with NSCLC or PDAC, as well as to investigate early signs of efficacy \\[Enrollment to all arms completed\\].","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":167,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Dose escalation","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Cohorts of 3 subjects will receive once weekly (Q1W) treatment with CAN04.

It will be coordinated by a consortium of researchers from UZA and UAntwerpen.\n\nLung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, worldwide and in Belgium. Prevention and early detection are considered the cornerstones to increase the chances of successful treatment and improved outcomes. There is strong scientific evidence that screening for lung cancer through an annual low-dose CT scan (LDCT) in a high-risk population of (ex-)smokers significantly reduces lung cancer mortality and is cost-effective. This implementation study will investigate the participation rate of eligible high risk (ex-)smokers in the First Line Zone (ELZ) South East Region of Antwerp (ZORA) in a LDCT screening program, combined with smoking cessation. Besides, other indicators of compliance, quality and turn-around-time will be estimated. It will give insights in the feasibility and potential challenges of implementing a LDCT lung cancer screening program in our region. This implementation project is in line with the European Commission Council recommendation of December 2022 to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of LDCT in a high-risk population. Findings from this study will contribute valuable evidence for policymakers and stakeholders. Furthermore, an implementation pilot is a prerequisite for a future high-quality population-based screening program."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Cancer, Nonsmall Cell","Lung Cancer","Smoking Cessation","Lung Cancer, Small Cell"],"keywords":["Lung Cancer Screening","Lung Cancer","Smoking Cessation"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SCREENING","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":700,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"High-risk (ex-) smokers","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Prevention and early detection of lung cancer are considered the cornerstones to increase the chances of successful treatment and improved outcomes.

The purpose of the Run-in Period was to determine whether any safety signals might compromise combination therapy and to determine the effect of ALK inhibitor therapy on the immune tumor microenvironment. For subjects with no dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the Run-in Period, combination therapy was then initiated during a dose-finding phase using a standard 3 + 3 design until determination of the RCD, which was defined as the highest dose level at which ≤ 1 of 6 subjects (i.e., \\< 33%) experienced DLTs during the first 2 cycles of combination treatment.\n\nA fixed dose of durvalumab (1500 mg by intravenous \\[IV\\] infusion every 4 weeks) was administered in all cohorts. Ensartinib dosing started at 200 mg, with subsequent cohorts receiving a reduced (150 mg) or escalated (225 mg) ensartinib dose depending upon observed toxicity. The study was then designed to include an expansion phase, in which the RCD cohort would be expanded to a total of 20 subjects.\n\nSubjects were monitored for safety (including immune-related adverse events), disease status (using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] version 1.1 and immune-related RECIST), and biologic activity (peripheral blood assays and immunological changes in the tumor microenvironment) for the duration of study participation."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Carcinoma","NSCLC"],"keywords":["ALK-rearranged","ALK-positive","ALK Inhibitor","Ensartinib","X-396","anti-PD-L1","Durvalumab","MEDI4736","ALK"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":2,"type":"ACTUAL"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Ensartinib ± Durvalumab","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Subjects were to receive ensartinib monotherapy during a pre-immunotherapy Run-in Period for one to two 28-day cycles, followed by combination therapy with ensartinib plus durvalumab for subjects with no DLTs during the Run-in Period.","interventionNames":["Drug: Ensartinib","Drug: Durvalumab"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Ensartinib","description":"Ensartinib was administered orally once daily at a dose of 200 mg during the Run-in Period.

Quaratusugene ozeplasmid consists of non-viral lipid nanoparticles that encapsulate a DNA plasmid with the TUSC2 tumor suppressor gene and is the first systemic gene therapy for cancer.\n\nThe study is comprised of a Phase 1 dose escalation portion and two Phase 2 portions evaluating safety and efficacy. Enrollment in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion is complete and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) was determined. Phase 2a has initiated and enrolled patients are treated with quaratusugene ozeplasmid at the RP2D in combination with osimertinib. In Phase 2b, patients will be randomized to receive either quaratusugene ozeplasmid plus osimertinib or platinum-based chemotherapy.","detailedDescription":"Acclaim-1 is an open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study evaluating quaratusugene ozeplasmid (Reqorsa) plus osimertinib (investigational arm) versus platinum-based chemotherapy (control arm) in patients with advanced metastatic or recurrent NSCLC.\n\nToxicities will be assessed by the Investigator using United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Serious Adverse Events and Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) will be reviewed by a Safety Review Committee.\n\nPhase 1 - Dose Escalation: The RP2D of quaratusugene ozeplasmid when given in combination with osimertinib has been identified.\n\nPhase 2a: This expansion cohort will be enrolled to better characterize safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of the combination therapy.\n\nPhase 2b: Quaratusugene ozeplasmid in combination with osimertinib will be further evaluated using the RP2D identified in Phase 1. Patients may receive local therapy, such as radiation therapy, to progressing lesions prior to enrollment. Patients will be randomized to receive either the investigational arm or the control arm in a 1 to 1 ratio and stratified based on prior local radiotherapy."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Carcinoma, Non-Small Cell Lung"],"keywords":["Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation (EGFR)","osimertinib","Tumor suppressor gene 2 (TUSC2)","Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)","Gene therapy","Tagrisso","FUS1-nanoparticles","NSCLC","Reqorsa","quaratusugene ozeplasmid"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1","PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","interventionModelDescription":"Phase 1: 3+3 dose escalation to identify RP2D.\n\nPhase 2: RP2D further evaluated in Phase 2a expansion followed by parallel randomization in a 1:1 ratio to either investigational arm or control arm.","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":158,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Investigational","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"In Phase 1, Phase 2a and the investigational arm of Phase 2b, patients will receive their assigned dose of quaratusugene ozeplasmid (intravenous administration once every 21 days) plus osimertinib (80 mg fixed dose oral tablet taken daily starting on Day 1 through Day 21 of every 21-day treatment cycle) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Biological: quaratusugene ozeplasmid","Drug: osimertinib"]},{"label":"Control","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"In the control arm of Phase 2b, patients will receive platinum-based chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.","interventionNames":["Drug: Platinum-Based Chemotherapy"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"quaratusugene ozeplasmid","description":"Quaratusugene ozeplasmid is an experimental non-viral immunogene therapy utilizing the TUSC2 gene, designed to target cancer cells by interrupting cell signaling pathways that allow cancer cells to grow, reestablishing pathways that promote cancer cell death and modulating the immune response against cancer cells.","armGroupLabels":["Investigational"],"otherNames":["Reqorsa"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"osimertinib","description":"Osimertinib is a 3rd generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) oral tablet administered daily, as indicated for treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR genetic deletions or mutations.","armGroupLabels":["Investigational"],"otherNames":["Tagrisso"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Platinum-Based Chemotherapy","description":"Cisplatin and carboplatin are intravenously administered platinum agents that are combined with other cytotoxic chemotherapy agents such as pemetrexed.","armGroupLabels":["Control"],"otherNames":["cisplatin","carboplatin"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) - Phase 1","description":"RP2D, which will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or, if the MTD is not defined by the safety data, RP2D will be determined based on an integrated assessment of all available clinical safety and preliminary efficacy data.","timeFrame":"First 21-day treatment cycle for each dose level cohort"},{"measure":"Overall Response Rate (ORR) - Phase 2a","description":"ORR (complete response \\[CR\\]+ partial response \\[PR\\]) according to RECIST using best overall response.","timeFrame":"Approximately 3 months"},{"measure":"Progression-free Survival (PFS) - Phase 2b","description":"PFS from randomization to disease progression or death.

Lung cancer screening (LCS) combined with smoking cessation saves the most lives. ICARE-LCS seeks to decrease health inequality and improve Veteran health by reducing smoking rates among Veterans receiving LCS. ICARE-LCS will use implementation methods to inform national cancer prevention efforts and build infrastructure necessary to support broad implementation of high-impact tobacco dependence treatment (TDT) processes in LCS programs.","detailedDescription":"The primary goal is to improve the delivery of tobacco dependence treatment (TDT) within Veterans Affairs (VA) lung cancer screening (LCS) programs. LCS with annual low-dose computed tomography saves lives through the early detection of lung cancer and is being broadly deployed, now at 113 VA medical centers. Due to the eligibility criteria selecting for current or previous smoking, 50-60% of LCS participants currently smoke. Modeling studies support that integrating TDT into LCS nearly doubles the benefit of the screening itself. Therefore, access to high-quality TDT is a program requirement per the VA LCS guidance memo.\n\nThough a robust integration of LCS and TDT is a VA priority, in reality there remains a gap in both reach and intensity of TDT for LCS participants. Guidelines and evidence support TDT processes that include 1) systematic assessment and connection to treatment (e.g. Ask-Advise-Connect, motivational interviewing, optout or proactive strategies) and 2) treatment that includes the evidence-based combination of intensive pharmacologic and behavioral treatments ('combined TDT'). Recent trials in LCS participants found high rates of agreeing to treatment using 'opt-out' motivational referral strategies and the highest cessation rates using a longitudinal \"chronic disease\" model that delivers combined TDT over a period up to a year. Unfortunately, relatively few Veterans in LCS receive any TDT and the treatment is usually inconsistent with guidelines and this evidence. In a national sample of LCS participants who smoke, only 16.4% received any pharmacotherapy for TDT, many under-dosed with short-acting nicotine replacement alone, and fewer than 1% received the recommended combination of behavioral and pharmacologic treatment. This represents a significant gap in care. Improving quality of TDT for Veterans in LCS has been identified as a priority area by multiple stakeholders including the Office of Oncology and Precision Medicine (OPM), the investigators' operational partner, the VA Lung Precision Oncology Program (LPOP), the White House Prevention and Screening Task Force, the National Committee for Quality Assurance and Veterans engagement groups. Each care process-LCS and TDT-is complex on its own, which has hampered integration. While some LCS processes are standardized across VA through use of the tools provided by the National Center for Lung Cancer Screening (NCLCS), individual LCS programs use varied care models. Programs can be 'centralized' (most LCS-related care is delivered by dedicated program staff) or 'hybrid,' where responsibilities are shared between primary care and LCS staff. NCLCS has worked with VAs across the country to enhance LCS quality and uptake. Individual LCS programs deliver combined TDT variably, and many processes are not adapted for the longitudinal, annual LCS process. The VA Tobacco Use Treatment Program Office (TUT) is currently conducting a pilot funded by the Cancer Moonshot to demonstrate feasibility of integrating TDT into LCS, recently expanded from 11 to 15 sites. The Minneapolis VA has conducted a VISN 23-Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) partnered implementation pilot to understand barriers and needs among diverse LCS programs, identifying many modifiable targets. The VISN 23 QUERI Team and TUT have collaborated to design an LCS-TDT toolkit that will soon be nationally available. While an important step, a toolkit alone may be insufficient to increase uptake of best practices. Tailored implementation support through intensive external facilitation may be necessary to effectively integrate TDT processes within the VA LCS landscape. With support from the operational partner, OPM, this project proposes to work with TUT and the NCLCS to build on existing efforts to increase participation in combined TDT for LCS participants. This project will utilize both retrospective data analysis and prospective data gathering to inform and tailor a toolkit for national dissemination. ICARE-LCS is an implementation evaluation study model.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nAim 1: Identify key process components of effective tobacco treatment programs in LCS and success factors for providing combined TDT. A mixed methods assessment will be conducted at 10 sites in the TUT Moonshot pilot, first qualitatively assessing their current TDT-LCS processes, success factors and perceived barriers to implementation of combined TDT. Data will then be linked with quantitative data of treatment participation and short-term cessation. Findings will be used to refine the toolkit for use in Aim 2 and nationally.\n\nAim 2: Test a multicomponent facilitation package to improve integration of TDT and LCS.\n\nSeven programs will be identified from among LPOP sites outside of the TUT pilot, ensuring variation in site characteristics (e.g. hybrid vs centralized model), and provided implementation support using external facilitation. Sites will be matched at least 1:1 to another site in the LPOP network that will receive implementation as usual (controls). The primary outcome will be penetration (participation in combined TDT, secondary outcome any treatment) with additional secondary outcomes of fidelity (ideal TDT), and effectiveness (short-term cessation).\n\nAim 3: Evaluate the implementation outcomes of feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, appropriateness, and cost of implementing TDT integrated with LCS, assessed among Veterans and care team members.\n\nImplementation outcomes other than cost will be assessed using qualitative methods. Cost will be examined related to the implementation support and to the TDT provided (e.g. LCS staff costs, pharmacotherapy, tobacco-related visits) using staff logs and VA pharmacy and billing data. Collectively, the above program evaluation will inform national cancer prevention efforts and build infrastructure necessary to support broad implementation of high-impact TDT processes in LCS programs."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Tobacco Dependence Treatment","Lung Cancer Screening"],"keywords":["Lung Cancer","Lung Nodule","Tobacco","Lung Cancer Screening"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"OTHER","timePerspective":"OTHER"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":7,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Veterans Participating in Lung Cancer Screening who Smoke","description":"Veterans participating in lung cancer screening who smoke and are receiving care at participating VA medical centers"},{"label":"Participating VA Medical Centers","description":"Seven sites that have agreed to participate in implementation intervention","interventionNames":["Other: External Facilitation"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"External Facilitation","description":"Multi-component facilitation strategy to address identified implementation needs","armGroupLabels":["Participating VA Medical Centers"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Receipt of Combined Tobacco Dependence Treatment","description":"Participation in counseling and pharmacotherapy within 90 days of lung cancer screening referral","timeFrame":"Approximately 3 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of Veterans Receiving ANY Tobacco Dependence Treatment Therapy","description":"Participation in ANY tobacco dependence treatment therapy (including but not limited to pharmacotherapy or counseling) for eligible Veterans in lung cancer screening who smoke","timeFrame":"Approximately 3 years"},{"measure":"Number of Veterans Receiving of Pharmacotherapy or Counseling Alone","description":"Participation in individual treatment options among patients in lung cancer screening who smoke.

Pembrolizumab administration can result in objective tumor responses in patients with\n\nmetastatic melanoma and is approved for use by the FDA for the treatment of these patients.\n\n* Administered TIL express low levels of PD-1, though PD-1 can be re-expressed on TIL in vivo following TIL administration.\n* In pre-clinical models, the administration of an anti-PD1 antibody enhances the anti-tumor activity of transferred T-cells.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nDetermine the objective response rate with the addition of\n\npembrolizumab to the standard non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, TIL, and\n\nhigh-dose IL-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma who have received prior anti-\n\nPD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Cohorts 1 and 3).\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 72 years\n* Evaluable metastatic melanoma\n* Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL\n* No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration\n* No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients with metastatic melanoma will have lesions resected for TIL\n* Patients will be assigned one of 3 cohorts: (1) patients who are refractory to prior\n\nanti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (randomized); (2) patients who have not received prior anti-\n\nPD-1/PD-L1 therapy; and (3) patients who are refractory to anti PD-1/PD-L1 (nonrandomized).\n\nNote: Cohorts 1 and 2 were closed upon the addition of Cohort 3.\n\n* After TIL growth is established: Patients assigned to Cohort 3 without contraindications to pembrolizumab, will be assigned to receive pembrolizumab in combination with the standard non-myeloblative (NMA) conditioning regimen, TIL, and high-dose IL-s (Arm 2). Patients in Cohort 3 with relative contraindicatioons to prembrolizumab will be assigned to receive standard NMA, TIL, and high dose IL-2 (Arm 3).\n* For those patients receiving pembrolizumab- Pembrolizumab will be administered immediately prior to TIL administration and continue for an additional three cycles following the cell infusion.\n* Up to 53 patients may be enrolled over 3-4 years."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Melanoma"],"keywords":["Melanoma","Skin Cancer","Immunotherapy","Cell Therapy"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":170,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"1/ACT TIL","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine +young TIL + highdose aldesleukin (IL-2)","interventionNames":["Biological: young TIL","Drug: Aldesleukin","Drug: Fludarabine","Drug: Cyclophosphamide"]},{"label":"2/ACT TIL + Pembro","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine +young TIL + highdose aldesleukin (IL-2) + pembrolizumab","interventionNames":["Biological: young TIL","Drug: Pembrolizumab","Drug: Aldesleukin","Drug: Fludarabine","Drug: Cyclophosphamide"]},{"label":"3/ACT TIL (Pembro contraindicated)","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine + young TIL + highdose aldesleukin (IL-2)","interventionNames":["Biological: young TIL","Drug: Aldesleukin","Drug: Fludarabine","Drug: Cyclophosphamide"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BIOLOGICAL","name":"young TIL","description":"Day 0: Cells will be administered intravenously (IV) on the Patient Care Unit over 20-30 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["1/ACT TIL","2/ACT TIL + Pembro","3/ACT TIL (Pembro contraindicated)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Pembrolizumab","description":"(Cohort 1, Arm 2 ,Cohort 2 and Cohort 3, Arm 2) On day -2, and days 21 (+/- 2 days), 42 (+/- 2 days), and 63 (+/- 2 days) following cell infusion: Pembrolizumab 2mg/kg IV over approximately 30 minutes.","armGroupLabels":["2/ACT TIL + Pembro"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aldesleukin","description":"Aldesleukin 720,000 IU/kg IV (based on total body weight) over 15 minutes approximately every 8 hours (+/- 1 hour) beginning within 24 hours of cell infusion and continuing for up to 4 days (maximum 12 doses).","armGroupLabels":["1/ACT TIL","2/ACT TIL + Pembro","3/ACT TIL (Pembro contraindicated)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Fludarabine","description":"Days -7 to -3, Fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 15-30 minutes for 5 days.","armGroupLabels":["1/ACT TIL","2/ACT TIL + Pembro","3/ACT TIL (Pembro contraindicated)"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Cyclophosphamide","description":"Days -7 and -6: Cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day X 2 days IV in 250 ml D5W with mesna 15 mg/kg/day over 1 hour X 2 days.","armGroupLabels":["1/ACT TIL","2/ACT TIL + Pembro","3/ACT TIL (Pembro contraindicated)"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Response rate","description":"Percentage of patients who have a clinical response to treatment (objective tumor regression)","timeFrame":"6 and 12 weeks after cell infusion, then every 3 months x3, then every 6 months x 2 years"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Frequency and severity of treatment-related adverse events","description":"Aggregate of all adverse events, as well as their frequency and severity","timeFrame":"30 days after end of treatment"},{"measure":"Overall survival","description":"Time from start of treatment to death from any cause","timeFrame":"Time of death"},{"measure":"Objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and safety (Cohort 3, Arm 3)","description":"Percentage of patients who have a complete response and/or partial response to treatment","timeFrame":"6 and 12 weeks after cell infusion, then every 3 months x 3, then every 6 months x 2 years"},{"measure":"Overall survival (Cohort 3, Arm 3)","description":"Time from start of treatment to death from any cause","timeFrame":"Time of death"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"-INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n1.

Little is known about the molecular mechanisms governing TCP in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), i.e. the most frequent lung cancer subtype. The investigators recently identified prognostic 7-miRNAs/10-mRNAs signatures which accurately identified aggressive LUAD among patients with early-stage disease (Stage I). Furthermore, the investigators showed that such tumors show TCP features i.e. mesenchymal and stem-cell traits, high-metastatic potential. Here, the investigators aim to explore by RNAseq and by immunophenotyping at a single-cell level (scRNAseq/AbSeq), the molecular features of aggressive LUAD to unveil the mechanisms triggering TCP. The investigators predict thier results will be relevant for the development of more effective therapeutic protocols for management of aggressive LUAD."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Lung Neoplasms","Progression"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":false,"designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":20,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"interventions":[{"type":"OTHER","name":"Analysis of diagnostic biomarkers","description":"The investigators will analyze TCP-biomarkers diagnostic by IHC, qRT-PCR and next-generation sequencing, in tumor and plasma samples of lung cancer patients."}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"TCP-biomarkers screening in a prospective cohort of lung cancer patients","description":"The investigators will: i) deconvolute the tumor epithelial cell heterogeneity of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) by coupling immunophenotype screening and single-cell RNAseq profiling of human LUAD samples; ii) identify subsets of LUAD cells with \"active\" tumor cell plasticity (TCP) using both our miRNA/RNA prognostic signatures, the C1-LUAD geneset (N=330), and previously identified signatures of lung cells high-cell plasticity (HCP) state; iii) explore the molecular features of TCP cell subsets by gene-network rewiring, pathway reconstruction analysis, and functional validation experiments of molecular \"HUBs\" controlling TCP pathways.
