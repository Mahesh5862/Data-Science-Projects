          "detailedDescription": "The study aims to identify asthma-related physiological changes observed by wearable devices in real-world conditions. The investigators aim to monitor multiple sensing modalities (e.g., heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), activity level, spirometry, coughing sounds) in order to find reliable signatures of impending asthma exacerbation and systematically explore any challenges on the use of wearable technologies. A variety of off-the-shelf devices as well as the prototype HET platform developed by the NCSU ASSIST center will be used for data collection.\n\nThe investigators plan to engage adolescents (ages 14-18) for a period of up to four months of monitoring. They will be asked to wear the wrist monitoring device for at least 8 hours daily and chest monitoring devices for at least 12 hours a week, to take daily measurements using a spirometer, and answer weekly questionnaires online and virtual interviews (at 1-week,1-month and 3-months) about their asthma control and experiences with the devices.\n\nWearable devices are increasingly popular with young people and are capable of providing dynamically calculated up-to-the-minute measurements of a number of physiologic parameters, including heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, activity levels, and cough. The cough sounds the investigators hope to capture during a forced-cough recording and while sleeping can be used as biomarkers for early detection of exacerbation. These changes could be used to predict an asthma exacerbation, and provide the wearer with instant feedback allowing the user to intervene early and prevent progression to more severe symptoms. Young adults are likely to adopt wearable technologies to facilitate chronic disease management, making this an ideal age group to examine the utility of wearable devices to detect early physiologic predictors of an impending exacerbation."

They will be identified as eligible for inclusion by the UNC Coordinator partner. However, they should not have any other lung disease other than asthma. They should not be taking any oral steroids every day to control their asthma. They should not need to use their asthma rescue medication multiple times a day to help with their asthma symptoms. They should not have experienced wheezing brought on when performing a lung function test.\n* Participants should have Wireless Internet access at their homes\n* Individuals with COVID-19 symptoms will be automatically excluded due to their clinical screening prior to their clinic visit. However, if a participant contracts COVID-19 during the study, they will be encouraged to continue participating since all interactions will be remote after the first clinical screening.\n* Adolescents should be able to use a iOS device (provided by the researchers) and the devices (with assistance from parents when appropriate) for data collection efforts. They cannot participate in this study if they don't feel comfortable with operating the multiple devices including the iOS device. The iOS device can only be used for the purposes of this study. The iOS device will be restricted by enabling Parental Control Settings accessible only to the researchers.\n* The participation of an adolescent may be terminated by the investigator if they do not follow the guidelines for the study, including using the devices as instructed or participating in the interviews and weekly surveys. Also, the monthly renewal for the participation of the study (up to 4 months) will be decided by the investigators on a month-by-month basis given that the participant also agrees to continue in the study.\n* Individuals with physical challenges are allowed to be incidentally included as long as they satisfy all the previous criteria.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* none listed",

A total of 106 participants will be randomized using a computer-generated allocation into two groups receiving either a 1.2 cm mesh (intervention group) or a 1.0 cm mesh (standard procedure).\n\nThe procedures will be conducted by a single experienced surgeon using a monofilament polypropylene mesh to ensure standardization. Surgical technique, anesthesia protocols, and perioperative management will be identical in both groups.\n\nPrimary outcome is objective cure, defined as negative stress test at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include symptom improvement (ICIQ-SF), mesh-related complications (erosion, infection, retention), and patient satisfaction assessed via structured Likert survey.\n\nFollow-up visits are scheduled at 1 week, 1 month, and 1 year. Postoperative assessments will be conducted by a blinded evaluator. The study aims to evaluate whether wider mesh width provides superior anatomical support and reduces complication rates in comparison to standard mesh."

          "detailedDescription": "Overall aim:\n\nTo investigate whether the novel FNB needle provides a better diagnostic accuracy than a standard FNA needle in EUS-B guided cancer diagnosis.\n\nDesign:\n\nProspective multicenter randomized control superiority study.\n\nPrimary study objective:\n\nComparing the ability to provide comprehensive phenotyping from microscopy histology/cytology to the molecular level to allow for optimal and early personalized cancer-specific therapy of FNA and FNB from tumors and lymph nodes adjacent to the esophagus/stomach using EUS-B in patients referred with suspected cancer.\n\nThe main focus are common deep-seated malignancies: NSCLC and lymphoma.\n\nStudy description:\n\nConsecutive patients referred due to suspected cancer with enlarged (at least 10 mm in the shortest axis) and/or FDG-avid lymph nodes or other lesions adjacent to the esophagus/stomach (e.g. suspected liver metastasis), thus with an indication for EUS-B, will be randomly assigned for tissue sampling either with a standard 22G FNA needle, or the novel 22G crown-cut FNB needle.\n\n280 patients with suspected lung cancer will be included and inclusion will end when the targeted number of 254 patients (127 in each group) with a final diagnosis of NSCLC is reached (see under statistics).\n\nLikewise, 82 patients with suspected lymphoma will be included until the targeted number of 74 patients (37 in each group) with a final diagnosis of lymphoma is reached (see under statistics).\n\nNeedles:\n\nThe standard needle for EUS-B is a 21G or 22G FNA-needle (fine needle aspiration), but new needles have been developed to obtain more histological material for immuno-histochemistry and mutation analyses. Larger biopsy specimens increase the diagnostic yield and allows for more mutation analyses, yet sample quality is not only determined by volume: larger tissue volume is obtained with a 19G versus a 22G FNA needle but with identical diagnostic yield.\n\nTissue volume seems also increased with EBUS using a 22G needle with a novel three-point crown-cut design (Franseen needle design) compared to a standard 22G FNA. However, the diagnostic yield did not increase, and one of the reasons addressed was the inability to penetrate the tracheal/bronchial cartilage (which is not at problem in EUS-B). Safety and adverse events did not differ from FNA.\n\nCrown-cut needles belongs to the third generation of fine needle biopsy needles (FNB). Within the third generation of FNB needles, studies comparing the different designs found that FNB needles with a multifaceted tip (crown-cut and fork-tip needles) were more superior than other designs of the same generation.\n\nNo study has investigated the use of the FNB needle in EUS-B. On this background, in the EUS-B study the investigator describe a systematic evaluation of the diagnostic superiority of a novel 3rd generation 22G FNB needle (SonoTip TopGain\u00ae, MediGlobe, Germany) over standard FNA, as well as evaluating its safety in EUS-B.\n\nStudy conduct:\n\nRecruitment and informed consent:\n\nThe investigator will recruit participants to the study among patients referred to the study sites with suspected cancer. Upon planning the diagnostic procedure, the doctor assesses if the patient can be included in the study. Here, the patient will receive oral information about the study by a healthcare professional who is familiar with the study. The conversation will take place in undisturbed conditions, where the patient can bring a co-sitter.\n\nThe patient will the receive a written information about the study, as well as a document explaining research participants rights in a health science research project as well as contact information about the research responsible doctor.\n\n24 hour consideration period is given to the patient who will be able to contact the research responsible doctor with questions about the study.\n\nThe patient can be included in the study once both the healthcare professional and the patient have signed the written informed consent document.\n\nThe patient have will have the ability to withdraw from the study at any time and without any consequences on further diagnostic investigation or treatment.\n\nRecruitment will begin in Region Zealand (N\u00e6stved and Roskilde) and once the study is established, a cooperation agreement as well as data processing agreement will be made with Odense University Hospital.\n\nThe EUS-B procedure:\n\nThe patients will be allocated to one of two groups based on either suspected lung cancer or deep-seated lymphoma. In each group, randomization will be performed in a 1:1 ratio using an online password-protected computer-generated system (RedCap). Moreover, randomization will be stratified based on cancer history, to ensure that there will be as many with suspected first time lung cancer or lymphoma and suspected recurrence/progression of a known cancer in each group.\n\nIf the patient is found suitable for inclusion and informed consent is obtained, the patient is immediately randomized to sampling with either FNA or FNB prior to the procedure.\n\nThe diagnostic work-up will be performed under conscious sedation as an out-patient procedure. After bronchoscopy (and EBUS if indicated), EUS-B is performed by sliding a linear EBUS echo-endoscope down the esophagus.\n\nSampling technique will be identical for both needles. Sampling, using an inner-stylet, will be performed by minimum two needle-passes per station using a fanning technique with suction. However, number of needle-passes might change if the operator finds it indicated, and it will be noted. Aspirates will be transferred to a dedicated container containing formalin, and at least one smear is produced on a glass slide. Samples are marked with patient ID and lesion location.\n\nThe pathologist will be blinded to group allocation. Only the study coordinator will have access to the randomization module.\n\nRapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) is not available at the study sites and will therefore not be utilized in the present study.\n\nThe diagnostic procedures will be performed by endoscopy experienced pulmonologists (minimum 200 EUS-B performed) from the respiratory department of each of the following Hospitals:\n\n* Zealand University Hospital, N\u00e6stved\n* Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde\n* Odense University Hospital, Odense\n\nBiological Material:\n\nNeedle biopsies of suspicious lesions are sent as per normal clinical practice to the Department of Pathology, where the material will be examined for the presence of cancer cells and genomic analyses will be performed when Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) is found.\n\nTissue material will as usual practice be received and analyzed at the Department of Pathology, where they have a Diagnostic Biobank to store tissue samples. This is not specific to this research study, and the investigator will not store any tissue after analysis.\n\nSpecimen processing:\n\nAll material will be prepared as per clinical standard, where tissue micro cores will be processed as cell blocks with formalin fixation and paraffin embedding. Smears are airdried for May-Gr\u00fcnwald-Giemsa staining. Each cell block will be stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and when relevant immunohistochemical stains specific for lung cancer will be used. In case of other cancer, supplementary stains will be used according to standard regimens. Tissue is additionally sent for flow cytometry in dedicated glass tubes when lymphoma is suspected.\n\nDiagnostic accuracy:\n\nDiagnostic accuracy of FNA and FNB will be compared and estimated using the equation \"diagnostic sample/all samples\". Specimens will be evaluated according to a local modified version of the Papanicolau classification of pulmonary specimens and categorized as either:\n\nI. Non-suitable II. Negative for malignancy III. Atypical cells (e.g. inflammatory or reactive changes) IV. Suspicious for malignancy V. Malignant\n\nMutational analysis:\n\nFollowing tumor content evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, and NSCLC is concluded, relevant regions are macrodissected and subjected to a standard genomic DNA extraction procedure using the GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen). DNA-concentration is estimated using a Qubit Fluorometer. All methods are carried out in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines with at least 20 % neoplastic content (estimated by pathologist) in each tissue sample. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) using the available NGS assay at the Department of Pathology will be performed on all NSCLC patients regardless of subtype.\n\nThe focus of the investigatior will be on the lung cancer associated biomarkers e.g. ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS and MET.\n\nRegarding lymphoma, analysis of tissue material will follow the normal clinical practice at the study sites, where subtyping is primarily based on immunohistochemistry and flowcytometry. The above mentioned NGS assay is performed in cases where tissue material is sparse. NGS is then necessary for classification of lymphoma subtype.\n\nStatistics:\n\nFor the suspected lung cancer subgroup:\n\nSample size calculation was based on expected difference in prevalence of successful comprehensive targeted genomic profiling of 13% (77% in FNA vs 90% in core needle biopsy, CNB). With 80% power (1-beta), significance level (alpha 0.05) this yields 254 patients. It is expected that 10% (26 patients) will have other diagnoses, so the number of included participants has to be 280 patients to diagnose 127 with NSCLC in each group (FNA vs FNB).\n\nFor the suspected lymphoma subgroup:\n\nSample size calculation was based on expected difference in diagnostic accuracy of 31.30% with transesophageal sampling of deep-seated lymphoma (91.30% in EUS-FNB and 60% in EUS-FNA). With 90% power (1-beta) and significance level (alpha) 0.05 this yields 74 patients.\n\nIt is expected that around 10% (8 patients) will have other diagnoses, so the investigator must include 82 patients to diagnose 37 patients in each group.\n\nDescriptive and analytical statistics will be performed using dedicated statistical software (STATA18.0; StataCorp\u00ae, Texas, US). Categorical data will be described as number (n) and percentage (%), and continuous variables as median and range. Intergroup differences in categorical variables will be analysed with Chi2-test or Fisher's test (if applicable), and differences in continuous variables with Mann-Whitney U-test."

          "briefSummary": "The supraglottic airway device(SAD), as an alternative to the endotracheal tube is inserted into the oral cavity and seals the upper esophagus and the surrounding tissue, effectively securing airway. SAD has evolved in recent years to increase efficiency and secure safety. The recently developed Ambu\u00ae AuraGain\u2122 is a second-generation SAD with a built-in gastric port and is designed to be fitted well in the larynx and oral cavity after insertion because the shaft is bent at an angle of 90 degrees and has an inflatable cuff.\n\nIn a previous study, Ambu\u00ae AuraGain\u2122 showed a higher sealing pressure and better fibreoptic finding compared to LMA Supreme in laparoscopic surgery.\n\nOn the other hand, I-gel and Ambu\u00ae AuraGain\u2122, both of the second-generation SAD, show comparatively excellent performance according to the results of previous studies. However, there are no studies comparing the characteristics of two airway devices in adults.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the performance of I-gel and Ambu\u00ae AuraGain\u2122 to make a difficult airway-like situation using cervical collar for adult patients receiving mechanical ventilation under general anesthesia."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to find a better way to prevent the post operative development of clots in the deep veins of the legs (also called Deep Vein Thrombosis or DVT). DVT causes redness, swelling, and pain in the involved leg(s). Long-term complications may include permanent swelling and pain of the leg(s), and even skin ulcers around the ankle. If clots form in a leg after surgery, and break off, they can move to the lungs and block the pulmonary artery (also called Pulmonary Emboli or PE). With PE there can be chest pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing up blood, heart failure, and occasionally death.\n\nDoctors have studied ways to reduce these complications. These studies led to the development of drugs which interfere with your body's clotting processes. However, it is still unclear which drug and which drug schedule is best. This study will evaluate two of the standard FDA approved drugs using different dosing schedules.",
          "detailedDescription": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Planned for elective primary arthroplasty for knee and hip disease at New England Baptist Hospital.\n2. Over 20 years of age.\n3. Normal baseline platelet count, prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times.\n4. Signed consent.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Surgery for acute fracture (\\< 4 weeks), septic joint, or extraction arthroplasty.\n2. Patients with personal history of TED, or documented hypercoagulation disease.\n3. Increased risk of hemorrhage, as from active gastric ulcer, or bleeding diathesis; or persistent intestinal or urinary tract bleed within the last year.\n\nSPECIFIC AIMS:\n\nThis prospective, randomized study seeks to determine if there is an advantage for fixed, low dose of warfarin Thromboembolic Disease (TED) prophylaxis among patients undergoing elective lower extremity joint arthroplasty, as compared to variable dose warfarin and a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). If confirmed as effective fixed, low dose warfarin would be an almost ideal prophylaxis against Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolus (PE): inexpensive, easy to administer, with minimal hemorrhagic potential, needing minimal laboratory support .\n\nBACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:\n\nA progression of studies has been performed to examine the efficacy of low dose warfarin. These studies demonstrated that low dose warfarin has antithrombotic activity, with little anticoagulant effect. Critical to this approach that the warfarin therapy be initiated prior to surgery. A summary of other studies offering supportive or conflicting data is available. (1-9)\n\n1. Low dose warfarin (2mg) dampens activated coagulation. (1-3)\n2. Two-step low dose warfarin begun 10-14 days pre-op is effective prophylaxis. (4)\n3. Low dose warfarin (1mg) prevents DVT's surrounding central venous catheters when started 3 days before catheter insertion among patients at very high risk for subclavian DVT. (5,6)\n4. Low dose warfarin (1mg) started 7 days prior to surgery is equal to variable dose warfarin for TED prophylaxis following hip arthroplasty. (7)\n5. Low dose warfarin (1mg) started 7 days prior to surgery is effective TED prophylaxis for patients having hip replacement arthroplasties in retrospective study of 1003 patients. (8)\n\nThe sentinel study used a fixed low dose warfarin regimen given to patients at extreme risk for DVT. Patients requiring central venous catheters for chemotherapy for metastatic cancer participated in a randomized study of 0.0 mg vs.1.0 mg daily warfarin starting 3 days prior to catheter placement. Subclavian vein venograms were performed at the time of symptoms of subclavian vein DVT or after 90 days. When using this low dose warfarin schedule there was a reduction in the incidence of thrombosis from 37.5% to 9.5%. (p\\<0.05) Four patients acquired vitamin K-responsive prolongation of the PT due to concomitant advanced liver disease and/or malnutrition. Concentrations of factors II, VII, IX, X, and protein C showed no difference between treated and untreated patients. (5)\n\nTwo orthopedic surgery studies from NEBH on this question have been published. (7,8) The first was a pilot study of 100 patients demonstrated no difference between the effectiveness of low fixed dose and variable dose warfarin in a population of patients at high risk for TED (7) Patients studied were planning total hip replacement arthroplasty were randomized between the standard regimens using warfarin of 5 mg the night prior to surgery followed by variable dose (target PT 1.3 - 1.5 times normal) for 30-45 days, or the experimental regimen using 1 mg beginning 7 days prior to surgery and continued until follow up at 30-45 days. Ultrasounds of the deep veins of the legs were performed at baseline, at discharge following surgery, and at 30-45 day follow-up. There was no difference between the groups for incidence of venous thrombosis. The second study was a retrospective study of patients undergoing primary (833) or revision (170) hip replacement arthroplasty receiving 1 mg warfarin for 7 days before surgery, variable dose while in hospital, (INR target 1.5 - 2.0) followed by 1 mg daily until follow-up at 30-45 days. (8) Each patient used pneumatic followed by elastic compression stockings. Of these 1003 patients, with 9 lost to follow-up. Three patients had TED, including 1 PE and 2 DVT."

The study will also explore factors that might influence cough strength and compare the usefulness of the two tools. Additionally, it will assess how patients feel about using these devices and the role of diaphragm ultrasound in predicting cough effectiveness."

          "briefSummary": "Early initiation of treatment for Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can prevent several of the long term problems associated with the condition. However, many RA patients develop lung inflammation and scarring, called 'interstitial lung disease' (RA-ILD), contributing to early death in 1 in 5 people. There is no proven treatment for these patients and some medications for RA can in fact worsen their lung disease. There is a need therefore to find safe medications that can not only control RA joint disease, but also prevent progression of RA-ILD. Abatacept is an approved drug for treating RA and is used widely. It is a newer RA medication, with a unique mechanism of action, and it has been shown to prevent progression of joint damage and improve physical function. The investigators aim to assess the safety of this medication in patients with RA-ILD and improve our understanding of the mechanism of lung damage in rheumatoid disease.\n\nThe investigators will perform a small clinical trial to assess the feasibility of performing a larger randomized controlled trial. A total of 30 patients with RA-ILD will be treated with abatacept infusions fortnightly for the first month, then every 4 weeks for a total of 20 weeks. In order to be eligible for the study, a patient must be able to provide written informed consent, be aged \u226518 years, and have interstitial lung disease that has not responded to or progressed over 6 months despite conventional immunosuppression. Change in lung function (forced vital capacity) at 24 weeks will be evaluated. To assess the mechanisms that may be involved with the development of ILD, the investigators will assess the effects of abatacept on biomarkers obtained from the blood and the lung (bronchoalveolar lavage), including markers of infection (the lung microbiome)."

          "briefSummary": "Background:\n\n\\- Tuberculosis (TB) is a lung infection caused by bacteria. When people with TB cough, they may spread these bacteria. Researchers are looking for new TB medicines. They want to find a faster way to tell if a drug might combat TB.\n\nObjective:\n\n\\- To learn the effect of different anti-TB drugs on microbiological, radiographic and immunologic markers in people with TB.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Adults age 18-65 who weigh 30-90 kg and have common TB bacteria that can be treated with common TB medicines.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be admitted to the hospital for screening. They will have medical history, physical exam, and chest radiograph. They will give blood, urine, and sputum samples.\n* Participants will be put in 1 of 8 groups.\n* Participants will get one or a combination of TB medicines daily for about 14 days.\n* Each day, participants:\n* Will discuss side effects.\n* May have a physical exam.\n* Will spit mucus into a cup. They may breathe in saline water through a nebulizer to make them cough.\n* Participants will have blood taken 3-4 times during the study\n* Participants will have 2-3 Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans. FDG is a radioactive sugar molecule which helps measure TB disease in the lungs. It will be injected into a vein. Participants will lie in a scanner that takes pictures.\n* Around study day 14, participants will leave the hospital. They will be referred to a local TB clinic. There they will get the standard 4 TB medicines. Those in group 8 will already be on these medicines and will have another FDG-PET/CT on day 28.\n* Participants will be in the study for up to 28 days.",
          "detailedDescription": "Early bactericidal activity (EBA), which measures decline in serial sputum colony forming unit (CFU) counts over the first 2-14 days of treatment, has been used extensively as a means of initially evaluating the potency of individual or combinations of antituberculous agents. This approach is endorsed by the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development and the US FDA. However, EBA seems to correlate poorly with the relative ability of an agent to prevent relapse and produce a durable cure (often referred to as sterilizing activity ). The reasons for this discrepancy may have to do with a limitation of sputum measurements to capture populations that persist beyond airway surfaces in discrete lesions such as granulomas, nodules, or cavities. The elimination of these persistent populations depend on the pharmacodynamic properties of a regimen and may be better captured by biologic and functional markers that can reflect dynamic treatment effects within these relevant host environments.\n\nRecent studies of the response to TB chemotherapy have identified promising new biomarkers of sterilization in 2 areas. First, immunologic changes appear to have potential in small subject cohorts to predict sterilizing cure within 1 month after commencing treatment. Second, 18F-FDG PET/CT has been used in tuberculosis as a qualitative means of assessing drug response in small case series at multiple time points, starting as early as 1 month. PET activity reflects uptake and phosphorylation of FDG by neutrophils and macrophages, and CT provides structural information on disease pathology. Hence, PET/CT data may offer additional insights into lesion-specific sterilizing activity. This study will add 18F-FDG PET/CT scans and immunological assays at 0, 2, and (in the HRZE arm) 4 weeks to standard EBA methodology using regimens containing isoniazid (INH \\[H\\]), rifampin (RIF \\[R\\]), pyrazinamide (PZA \\[Z\\]), moxifloxacin (MXF \\[M\\]), and ethambutol (EMB \\[E\\]). We hypothesize that drug regimens associated with higher sterilizing activity (e.g., containing rifampin or pyrazinamide) will show distinctive early cytokine and chemokine patterns and discrete, quantifiable changes on PET/CT in certain lesion types during the 2-week period, compared to drug regimens with poor sterilizing activity (e.g., containing isoniazid or moxifloxacin). Demonstration of such an association would provide rationale for including radiologic and immunologic analysis, alongside conventional EBA, in early phase clinical studies of novel drugs, and would also provide important new insights into the biology of human and bacterial responses to TB drugs."

          "briefSummary": "Researchers in this study want to find the optimal therapeutic dose of drug BAY1817080 for patients with long-standing cough with or without clear causes (refractory and/or unexplained chronic cough, RUCC). Study drug BAY1817080 is a new drug under development for the treatment of long-standing cough. It blocks proteins that are expressed by the airway sensory nerves which are oversensitive in patients with long-standing cough. This prevents the urge to cough. Researchers also want to learn the safety of the study drug and how well it works in reducing the cough frequency, severity and urge-to-cough.\n\nParticipants in this study will receive either the study drug or placebo (a placebo looks like the test drug but does not have any medicine in it) tablets twice daily for 12 weeks. Observation for each participant will last about 18 weeks in total. Participants will be asked to wear a digital device to record the cough and to complete questionnaires every day to document the symptoms. Blood samples will be collected from the participants to monitor the safety and measure the blood level of the study drug."

The LCQ was a 19-item instrument that asked about the impact of chronic cough on various aspects of participants' lives using a recall period of two weeks. The 8 items: 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15 built the physical domain. 7 items: 4, 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17 built the psychological domain. Further 4 items: 7, 8, 18 and 19 built the social domain. Study participants responded to the items using a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (all of the time) to 7 (none of the time) and entered their assessments on a tablet device. Completion of the LCQ took approximately five minutes. The LCQ total score was calculated as a mean score for each of the three domains ranging from 1 to 7, with the LCQ total score ranging from 3 to 21.",

Study participants responded to the items using a 7-point Likert scale from 1 (all of the time) to 7 (none of the time) and entered their assessments on a tablet device. Completion of the LCQ took approximately five minutes. The LCQ total score was calculated as a mean score for each of the three domains ranging from 1 to 7, with the LCQ total score ranging from 3 to 21. The percentage of participants with a \\>= 1.3-point increase in LCQ total score is shown.",

          "briefSummary": "The use of inhaled medications for the treatment of pulmonary diseases allows for the delivery of a high concentration of a drug at the site of disease with reduced systemic absorption and risk of systemic adverse effects. Inhaled Tobramycin has been successfully used in the maintenance treatment of CF patients with chronic colonization with PA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa). In the CF population TOBI has been proven to improve lung functions, decrease the density of the PA in the sputum, decrease hospitalizations, and reduce the risk of mortality.\n\nNon CF Bronchiectasis share many features in common with CF, including frequent colonization with PA that leads to deterioration in lung function and increased morbidity. A recent Cochrane review concluded that there is a small benefit for the use of prolonged antibiotics in the treatment of bronchiectasis, however further randomized controlled trials with adequate power and standardized end points are required.\n\nThere have been reports in the literature describing the efficacy of inhaled tobramycin the treatment of patients with non CF bronchiectasis with eradication of PA, and significant improvement in respiratory symptoms. There were however patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse events most commonly cough wheezing and dyspnea. (Scheinberg and Shore, Chest 2005).\n\nTOBI Podhaler is a dry powder inhaler that was recently launched, and is much easier and faster to use compared to nebulised Tobramycin. To the best of our knowledge Tobramycin dry powder formulation has not yet been trialed in patients with non CF bronchiectasis.\n\nThe purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of TOBI Podhaler in patients with non CF bronchiectasis, and to gather more data on the benefit of continuous antibiotic therapy in patients with non CF bronchectais."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find the best sedation necessary for patients undergoing bronchoscopy. Patients are randomized to three different regimes of sedation during bronchoscopy were studied:\n\n1. \\- Group standard/control: local anesthesia only(C)\n2. \\- Group alfentanil + local anesthesia(A)\n3. \\- Group dexmedetomidine + local anesthesia(D) The primary endpoint is the bronchoscopy score. Secondary endpoints are: Level of sedation and tolerance bronchoscopy examination. Measured parameters on the safety of examination are: the lowest saturation, needs to supplemental oxygen, amnesia , choking sensation or chest pain and if the patient is ready or not to undertake bronchoscopy second time in his life if necessary. Endtidal CO2, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Heart rate, level of oxygen are collected every 5 minutes before, during and after the bronchoscopy.",
          "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND:\n\n1. Problem:\n\n   The endoscopy of the tracheobronchial tree by endoscopy is an act very common in the daily activity of pulmonologists. The indications for bronchoscopy are multiple and include infectious causes, tumor, systemic disease, foreign bodies and other indications. It can be diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Bronchoscopy is an invasive but rarely, however, induced severe complications (respiratory failure, hemodynamic collapse, massive bleeding ...). However, tolerance to the examination varies significantly between patients \\[1-3\\]. Different signs and symptoms include desaturation, chest pain, choking sensation and cough. These effects are likely to alter patient comfort during the procedure and the quality of it. To further improve the tolerance operators have resorted to various techniques. A first step in improving the comfort is a good local anesthesia using spray or swab intra nasal base and lidocaine anesthesia of the airway (trachea, carina and bronchi) during the examination. The second step involves the use of intravenous sedation \\[1, 3-14\\].\n2. Background:\n\nUntil now, there is no standardized protocol for the best product and the best dose to use for sedation of patients. Several studies have been done comparing different drug or drug combination in the benzodiazepine family, ketamine or morphine with varying results and not leading in most cases to allow conclusions to establish clear guidelines regarding the use or no sedation plus local anesthesia and sedation dose of this \\[1, 3, 5, 8, 15\\]. Especially, for fear of adverse effects of sedation on respiratory function, many pulmonologists far are a little hesitant about the administration of sedatives during bronchoscopy. Dexmedetomidine is a new molecule sedation which is approved for its sedative effect while holding a revival meeting described as \"awake sedation.\" \\[12, 16-22\\]\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nThe aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of three different regimes of sedation during bronchoscopy:\n\n* Group standard / control (local anesthesia only): (C)\n* Group alfentanil (+ local anesthesia): (A)\n* Group dexmedetomidine (+ local anesthesia): (D)\n\nThe primary endpoint is:\n\n1. / Feasibility / tolerance of bronchoscopy by the \"score bronchoscopy\" which includes:\n\n   * The movement of the vocal cords (4 levels)\n   * Cough (4 levels)\n   * Movement members (4 levels)\n\n   Secondary objectives:\n2. / level sedation for bronchoscopy:\n\n   * Level of sedation achieved according to the objective using: Nursing Instrument for the Communication of Sedation (NICS) (7 levels).\n   * Dose of midazolam necessary complementary in each group. Midazolam to give to the judgment of the operator (if necessary) is predetermined speed (1 mg each minute) to the level of sedation (-1) \"Level of sedation achieved according to the objective using: Nursing Instrument for the communication of Sedation (NICS)\".\n3. / Tolerance examination:\n\n   * During the procedure\n   * At the end of the procedure\n   * After 1 hour of the end of the examination"

          "detailedDescription": "This study used a 6 treatment arm, parallel-group, randomized, double-blind study design. 974 male and female COPD patients were randomized into the trial. The study consisted of four distinct study periods:\n\n* Screening (Weeks -3 to -2): Participants underwent a screening period of 1 week where were assessed for eligibility and tapered off disallowed medications.\n* Run-in (Days -14 to 1): Subsequently, participants entered the run-in period of up to 2 weeks to establish baseline values for symptom assessments, to standardize the COPD background therapy (triple combination LABA/LAMA/ICS), and to complete eligibility assessments.\n* Treatment (Day 1 to Week 24): Eligible participants moved into the Day 1 visit where they were stratified according to their smoking status (current or ex-smoker) and severity of airflow limitation (FEV1 \u2265 30% to \\< 50% and \u2265 50% to \\< 80%) and then randomized into 1 of 6 treatment arms with a randomization ratio of 2:2:1:1:1:2 (450 mg b.i.d., 300 mg b.i.d., 150 mg b.i.d., 75 mg b.i.d., 25 mg b.i.d., placebo). The treatment period consisted of 24 weeks, during which the participant returned to the site for regular visits (Day 1 - Week 24). QBW251 450 mg arm was discontinued early based on a pre-defined pharmacokinetic exposure stopping rule.\n* Follow-up (Weeks 25-28): Upon completion of the treatment period, participants were followed up for safety assessments for 30 days."

Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) is calculated as the volume of air forcibly exhaled in one second as measured by a spirometer. Baseline measurement was defined as the baseline visit pre-bronchodilator spirometry assessment. A positive trend for change from baseline in FEV1 across the dose range is considered a favorable outcome.",

The number analyzed per row represents participants with evaluable data at each time point. Results for the QBW251 450 mg arm need to be interpreted with caution as the arm was discontinued early based on a pre-defined pharmacokinetic exposure stopping rule.",

The E-RS comprises 11 severity items and higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. The Cough and Sputum subscale score has a range of 0 to 11 and was derived as the sum of items 2 - 4.\n\nChange from baseline in the E-RS Cough and Sputum weekly mean scores were analyzed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM): treatment + baseline score + smoking status at screening + run-in E-RS + airflow limitation severity + region + time interval + treatment\\*time interval interaction + baseline score\\*time interval interaction.\n\nThe mean baseline E-RS Cough \\& Sputum subscale score was the average of the corresponding daily scores from the run-in period. Lower scores in the change from baseline correspond to lower symptom severity.",

It contains a total of 20 items on a 5-step scale distributed in 4 domains: Cough symptoms, Cough impact, Sputum symptoms and Sputum impact. All items are rescored from 1-5 to 0-4 and then reverse scored such that better responses have higher scores. The four domains are ranged from 0-100 where higher scores associated with fewer symptoms/less impact due to cough or sputum.\n\nChange from baseline in the CASA-Q cough and symptoms scores were analyzed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM): treatment + baseline score + smoking status at screening + run-in E-RS + airflow limitation severity + region + time interval + treatment\\*time interval interaction + baseline score\\*time interval interaction.",

The number analyzed per row represents participants with evaluable data at each time point.

Cmax was calculated from plasma concentration data using non-compartmental methods and summarized using descriptive statistics. Cmax was measured in the samples taken at 3 hours post-dose with the exception of the participants included in the Serial PK set on Days 1 and 15 for whom all samples (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose) were taken into consideration for the measurement of Cmax. All concentrations below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were treated as zero.",

The number analyzed per row represents participants with evaluable data at each time point. Results for the QBW251 450 mg arm need to be interpreted with caution as the arm was discontinued early based on a pre-defined pharmacokinetic exposure stopping rule.",

To properly evaluate neuromuscular function during the surgury, baseline supramaximal stimulation of the monitored nerve is mandatory. Not knowing if the priming dose of muscle relaxant affects the supramaximal stimulation current setting, The investigators designed this study to find out.",
          "detailedDescription": "The NMT monitor module automatically determines the current needed for the supramaximal stimulus, and maintains this current throughout the procedure.\n\nThe supramaximal current is the current above which there is no increase in the evoked muscle response. At this stimulus current, all motor units are firing in response to nerve stimulation. According to previous studies, the current was significantly increased in the presence of edema and peripheral neuropathy. In this study, the route of administration, dosage, dosage regimen, and treatment period are basically the same as the investigators anesthesia department's routine procedure for general anesthesia. The difference will be the time the investigators set between the priming dose to final dose of rocuronium is 2 minutes. The investigators use 2 minutes as the peak effect of rocuronium is 105\u00b136S.\n\nTo properly evaluate neuromuscular blockade during the surgery, baseline supramaximal stimulation of the monitored nerve is mandatory. Not knowing if the priming dose of muscle relaxant affects the supramaximal stimulation current setting, the investigators designed this study."

          "briefSummary": "With the HOBBIT trial, the investigators want to develop a technology that allows volunteers to hold their breath for a long time. This technique will then be taught to patients with breast cancer to be able to hold their breath long-term during the irradiation. After all, research has shown that the heart is in a better position when the patient enters her breath after a deep inhalation, as a result of which there is less unwanted radiation of the heart. To develop this technique the investigators use healthy volunteers, who are asked several times to hold their breath as long as comfortable. Before the respiratory arrest the investigators allow these volunteers to hyperventilate, administer oxygen and cause hyperinflation of the lungs.\n\nThe volunteers come back four times, on four consecutive days. The first day they receive a short training. Afterwards oxygen is administered for a few minutes while the volunteers are asked to hyperventilate. Afterwards, by using the learned technique, they must hold their breath for as long as possible, comfortably. They should hold their breath 3 times in total with a short break in between. The following days there is always a change in the preparation protocol, compared to the previous study. Different parameters in the protocol will be changed for different groups of volunteers, this is based on randomization. In this way the effect of different parameters in the preparation of the AHS can be investigated. The investigators will use this information to develop a new protocol for extending the duration of breathing to two minutes and thirty seconds for use during radiotherapy treatment. The method for finding the optimal technique is iterative optimization. This method follows a process of development, testing, feedback and redevelopment cycles. Iteratively, these cycles of development use the prior research to further elaborate the most promising discoveries and drop paths that do not produce the desired result. During the development The investigators listen to the input of different people: doctors, nurses, support staff, engineers and the participants, to guarantee the usability of the technique on the radiotherapy device. Once the researchers think they have found a solution that meets all the conditions, a group of untrained volunteers are asked to implement the technique. With this the investigators validate the technique for later use in breast cancer patients.",
          "detailedDescription": "Radiotherapy (RT) has an established role in breast cancer, complementing surgery and systemic therapies to prevent recurrences and improve survival. Long-Term follow-up shows that the beneficial effect on survival is weakened by radiation-induced cardiac and lung cancer mortality, especially in patients with left sided breast cancer or requiring irradiation of regional lymph nodes. Cardiac toxicity is of major concern because many patients receive cardiotoxic systemic treatments like anthracyclines and trastuzumab. Dose and volume of the heart exposed to radiation correlate with severity of cardiac toxicity. The heart dose-volume parameters are highest for patients receiving left-side radiotherapy especially if irradiation of the internal mammary lymph nodes is performed. Risk of (fatal) ischemic heart attack increases linearly with mean heart dose with no known dose threshold. In patients who receive left-side local treatment, heart dose is decreased by using prone positioning or deep-inspiration breath hold (DIBH), or a combination of both.\n\nPrevious research has shown that the heart shifts to an anatomical more favorable position in DIBH, away from the breast, chest wall and internal mammary lymph nodes, reducing heart dose. This advantage remains in prone positioning. The goal is to prolong the duration of a single DIBH, to create a long-DIBH (L-DIBH). Possible advantages are better positioning of the patient, execution of technically more difficult procedures and inclusion of regional lymph node (locoregional) irradiation. Most patients can't sustain a DIBH long enough to perform simulation with computed tomography (CT) and delineation during DIBH, so delineation of the laser lines during CT-simulation is performed on the shallow breathing (SB) scan. During positioning of the patient on the radiotherapy machine, a daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) is performed. The duration of this CBCT is 40 seconds, maintaining DIBH during this period is also hard for most patients. So currently the positioning at the moment of treatment is based on the SB CT-scan, whilst the DIBH CT-scan is used for treatment. This could potentially induce suboptimal positioning. Breath hold during CBCT positioning and CT-simulation and delineation could minimize shifts in treatment position. The current DIBH schedules for whole breast cancer radiotherapy without inclusion of the lymph nodes, use between three and six DIBHs of 12 to 18 seconds. Longer DIBH could lead to less DIBHs and faster treatment execution, which is especially important when the lymph nodes are included in the target volumes. Locoregional irradiation, including the lymph nodes, requires between 10 and 14 DIBHs of 15-30 seconds which leads to a total treatment time of around 5 minutes. This represents a substantial physical and mental effort for all but the most able patients.\n\nThis research, the first phase of the Hyperventilation Oxygenation Breath hold in Breast cancer Irradiation Treatment (HOBBIT) trail, will focus on finding a technique to assist patients to maintain a long DIBH (L-DIBH) during radiotherapy. Other research has shown a potential increase in duration of breath hold and reduction in rest time between DIBHs using oxygen in combination with hyperventilation. There is a safe way to prolong DIBH to at least 5 minutes. However, the technique requires a long training period for the patient, and 15 minutes of mechanical ventilation before each treatment session, making the technique very time consuming and resource intensive. The investigators hope to simplify the technique by allowing patients to do multiple L-DIBHs during the 5 minutes of treatment time. The investigators found from preliminary tests that using shorter L-DIBHs has several advantages, firstly pre-oxygenation and induction of hypocapnia can be achieved in a shorter time, secondly the duration of training is reduced, and thirdly a the costs are reduced.\n\nIncrease in blood pressure is the main risk of L-DIBH. No adverse events of L-DIBH have been reported. In order to minimize the risks during testing, this research project was developed in collaboration with the anesthesiology department, to ensure safety of the participants during L-DIBH. For all subjects, vital parameters will be continuously monitored by medical staff. Safety boundaries are in place which subjects are not allowed to cross during L-DIBH.\n\nThe aim of this research is to develop a new and easy technique for L-DIBH in prone and supine position, feasible for daily use at our radiotherapy department. The purpose of the technique is to allow locoregional treatment using a reasonable amount of L-DIBHs, increase patient positioning and accuracy of radiation treatment, and further significantly reduce heart toxicity for left sided cancer patients. The HOBBIT trial includes multiple phases. The first phase is performed on healthy volunteers, different support techniques to prolong DIBH will be tested. In the second phase the most optimal techniques to perform a L-DIBH will be validated on breast cancer patients. Around 40 volunteers will be included in the first phase of the HOBBIT trail, the final amount of volunteers depends on the amount of testing needed to find a technique which fulfills all criteria for phase two. The second phase of the HOBBIT trail will include breast cancer patients treated at our radiotherapy center. The expectations from previous research is that the investigators will see a similar increase in DIBH time, compared to healthy volunteers. The final goal is the use of the technique during locoregional radiation therapy at the University Hospital of Ghent."

          "detailedDescription": "Aspiration pneumonia is a common complication in senior patients with high morbidity and mortality rate. The decline of physical function among elders can easily lead to swallowing disorders, and nasogastric (NG) tube insertion is an emergency medical treatment that provides patients with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, NG is easily dislodged after a long duration of placement; furthermore, lacking accurate feeding skills could also lead to aspiration pneumonia. An appropriate NG care model to lower feeding complications is an essential issue. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of eating rehabilitation training in the removal of NG tubes among elderly patients with aspiration pneumonia. This is an experimental, convenient sampling study. We enrolled first-time NG tube insertion friends and complicated with aspiration pneumonia. All patients in this study were from the medical ward of a tertiary center in northern Taiwan. The target numbers are ninety-six patients. The eligible subjects will be randomized to the experimental and the control group. The experimental group will receive eating rehabilitation training, including oral care, saliva gland massage, oral exercise, feeding strategy, and swallowing skill education. The control group will receive routine medical care. The endpoint of this study includes 1. The timing of NG removal, 2. The re-insertion rate after one month of NG removal, 3. 30 days unexpected re-admission rate. The characteristics and distribution of variables were described by percentage, mean, and standard deviation. The Chi-square test was used to analyze the difference between-group differences on the 30 days of NG re-insertion and re-admission rate. The timing of NG removal between the two groups was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival. All statistical analyses were performed on Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. This study's results provide caregivers with more successful strategy for removing senior aspiration pneumonia patients' nasogastric tubes and improving early oral intake and patients' quality of life."

          "briefSummary": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication following cardiac surgery with an estimated incidence around 35%. It has been found to be an independent predictor of 30-day and 6-month mortality, stroke, renal failure, respiratory failure, and need for permanent pacemaker among others. Previous studies including meta-analyses demonstrate a protective benefit of prophylactic amiodarone to decrease the risk of POAF. However, this has not been widely adopted, and recent society guidelines only give prophylactic amiodarone a Class IIA recommendation, citing risk of amiodarone-related toxicity and hypotension as reasons for the Class IIA recommendation. A meta-analysis comparing cumulative doses of amiodarone found that moderate to higher doses of amiodarone have a marginally increased benefit in reducing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation over lower doses; however, the study did not assess risk of complications stratified by cumulative doses, which has been previously described. Finally, a recent meta-analysis showed that a posterior pericardiotomy was highly effective at reducing postoperative atrial fibrillation. Consequently, the investigators' institution has adopted a pharmaco-surgical approach (prophylactic amiodarone and posterior pericardiotomy) in an effort to reduce postoperative atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass cardiac surgery for all patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria."

          "briefSummary": "This is an observational study in which patient data from the past of people who received Ultravist prior to an X-ray based scan are studied.\n\nIn observational studies, only observations are made without specified advice or interventions.\n\nX-ray based imaging like computed tomography or angiography is used to make pictures of the structures inside the body. These pictures are needed in various medical situations. In some X-ray tests, the patient is given a compound called \"contrast agent\" that is injected into the vein. It helps to create clearer pictures as it makes internal body structures easier to see. With such contrast-enhanced imaging techniques, doctors can better see certain problems.\n\nUltravist is an iodine-based contrast agent. It is also called iopromide, and it is available for doctors to give patients before they have X-ray based scans.\n\nClinical studies on the overall safety of Ultravist have shown that hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) may rarely occur. HSRs are undesirable reactions of the body's defense system (immune system) to the study drug. However, more information on HSRs is needed.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to find out whether certain groups of people are more likely to have HSRs after Ultravist injection than others (e.g., depending on gender, race, or country/region).\n\nTo do this, researchers will collect data from people with HSRs (all ages) after contrast-enhanced X-ray scans with Ultravist. These data come from four observational studies that have already been completed. Participants who had HSRs will be compared with participants in these studies who had no medical problems after receiving Ultravist to learn more about the characteristics of people at higher risk.\n\nData will be from the year 1999 up to 2011. No visits or tests are required as part of this study."

In collecting data Information Form Based on Watson Human Care Theory, the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Self-efficacy Scale, St. George Quality of Life Scale, and Pulmonary Function Test Form were used. Individuals in the intervention group were provided with training and consultancy based on Watson Human Care Theory, and an educational booklet prepared with current guides and expert opinions. Telephone counseling was provided in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th weeks after the first intervention in the intervention group. Routine follow-up of individuals in the control group was continued. The data of the scales in the intervention and control groups are collected in the 12th week. The individuals in the control group were given a training booklet at the end of the study. Statistical analysis of the data was done with SPSS 22.0 software package."

The total score is calculated by the score of each of the answers given. There are 34 items in the total of the subtitles, a minimum of 34 points and a maximum of 170 points. High scores indicate that the level of self-efficacy is high. To find the overall score of the subscales, the total score is divided by the number of items that make up the subscale. In comparison, if there is an increase in score in the posttest compared to the pretest, it is interpreted that the degree of confidence in managing breathing difficulties or avoiding increased.

SGRQ is a 50-item scale under three main titles developed in 2001: symptoms (8 items), activities (16 items), effects of the disease (26 items).\n\nIt is a scale that investigates the relationship between dyspnea, sputum, cough, respiratory status, and daily activity, especially in individuals with COPD. Its highest score is 100 and it expresses the highest level of negative status. Cronbach's alpha value of SGRQ was calculated as 0.88 for the whole scale, and it was found in the validity analysis that it correlated significantly with similar scales (p \\<0.0001). The SGRQ scale was translated into Turkish by Polatl\u0131 et al. (2013) and its validity and reliability study was conducted.

          "briefSummary": "The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication called osimertinib (TAGRISSO\u00ae) when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective than giving osimertinib alone for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).\n\nOsimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.\n\nIn total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30 patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately 556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.\n\nThe study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15 visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the study centre."

Scores range from 0-100 after a linear transformation.\n\nTime to deterioration (TTD) is defined as the time from randomization until the date of the first clinically meaningful worsening (a change in the score from baseline of \u226510) that is confirmed at a subsequent assessment or death in the absence of a clinically meaningful symptom, function, or global health status/QoL worsening, regardless of whether the patient withdraws from study treatment or receives another anticancer therapy prior to symptom, function or GHS/QoL deterioration.

Questions assess cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, site specific pain, sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia and pain medication. While the QLQ-LC13 includes more scales, only the Coughing, Pain in chest, and Dyspnea subscale scores were analyzed for this endpoint.\n\nNegative change from baseline scores indicates less symptom severity, and thus improvement on health status.\n\nThe score values calculated by averaging across patients overall mean across all visits. The analysis was performed using a MMRM analysis on the change from baseline in the score at each visit, including subject (as a random effect), treatment, visit (as fixed effect and repeated measure) and treatment by visit interaction as explanatory variables, with the baseline score as a covariate along with the baseline score by assessment interaction.",

In addition, data on safety and tolerability of roflumilast will be obtained. An additional objective is to further characterize the population pharmacokinetic profile of roflumilast and roflumilast N oxide and to further characterize their pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship in terms of efficacy and relevant safety aspects.\n\nPatients to be included are required to have severe COPD associated with chronic bronchitis and a history of frequent exacerbations and must be concomitantly treated with a fixed combination of LABA and ICS. Two parallel treatment arms (roflumilast 500 \u03bcg once daily and placebo) are included.",
          "detailedDescription": "The drug tested in this study is called Roflumilast. Roflumilast is being developed to treat people who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study investigated the effect of roflumilast 500 \u03bcg tablets once daily versus placebo on exacerbation rate, pulmonary function, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in COPD patients who were concomitantly treated with a fixed combination of long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) and inhaled glucocorticosteroids.\n\nThe study was targeted to enroll approximately 1934 patients. Participants were randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which remained undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there was an urgent medical need):\n\n* Roflumilast 500 \u03bcg once daily\n* Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this was a tablet that looked like the study drug but had no active ingredient\n\nTrial treatment was taken in the morning by mouth after breakfast with some water.\n\nThe trial consisted of the following periods:\n\n* Single-blind baseline period (4 weeks) during which all patients received placebo.\n* Double-blind treatment period (52 weeks) during which patients received either roflumilast or matching placebo.\n* Safety follow-up (30 days after end of treatment (Vend) or premature discontinuation date) in case of ongoing Adverse Events at Vend, if necessary.\n* Follow-up visit 12 weeks after end of treatment, at Week 64 (VFU), only for patients who completed the trial as scheduled.\n\nThis multi-center trial was conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this study was up to 64 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic which included a follow-up visit at week 64."

          "detailedDescription": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) SARS-Cov-2 disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus. The pandemic first described in Wuhan, China, has since spread across the whole world and caused dramatic strain on health care in many countries. The virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.1 Patients infected with the virus mostly report mild to moderate respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath and coughing, and febrile symptoms. Most recover without requiring special treatment. However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer) are more likely to develop serious illness.1 Younger patients have been reported with serious illness as well. In the present situation, it is of paramount importance to preserve health service capacity by identifying those with serious illness without transferring all infected patients to emergency rooms or Hospitals. In addition, it is important to identify seriously ill patients early enough and before they reach a point of deterioration where they can be extremely challenging to handle in both prehospital and hospital environment.\n\nThe number of subjects with positive test of the virus is increasing and so does the number of patients hospitalized.2 In parallel, most patients with positive test result or typical clinical symptoms are at home with information what to do if their clinical symptom status deteriorates.2 The Norwegian Interaction Reform was implemented in 2012.3 Key elements of the reform are guidance of the health care in the future and identify new directions. Prevention and early efforts are important and this will be achieved by creating co-working arenas for different parts of our health system. More health services must be moved closer to where the inhabitants live and simultaneously strengthening the community health system. New tools for monitoring the well-being of the patients must be developed in order to act early enough to avoid severe deterioration of health status and avoid new hospitalization. This goal has become even more important during the Covid 19 pandemic because the healthcare system is not prepared or built to take care of all these patients in hospitals.\n\nIn the local community's wearable and wireless biosensors collecting continuous physiological data (CPD) in real time in order to generate information reflecting the patients' current state is established. This is recognized as welfare technology, and it is a generic term for a heterogeneous group of technologies.4 There are few studies documenting their efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency. One key driver for the development of wearable biosensors is the potential to use CPD to generate real-time, clinically actionable insights from predictive analytics that include early warnings of clinical deterioration and prompts for behavioral changes. The advent of machine learning methods that can detect subtle patterns from large sets of CPD may make this achievable.\n\nUsing CPD to guide clinical decisions may be a major advance for patients with chronic diseases and at present time when our health system is put on an extreme stretch. This may drive the evolution from episodic to continuous patient care.\n\nThe present study is designed to sample biosensor data from patients treated and observed at home due to mild and moderate SARS-Cov-2 disease. Such a system would be useful, both for the treatment of individual patients as well as for assessing the efficacy and safety of care given to these patients. Investigators intend to improve quality and safety of home care by continuous monitoring and a set of rules for follow-up.\n\nInvestigators hypothesized that patients and local health system may benefit from the feedback of a simple monitoring system, which detects changes in respiration, temperature and circulation variables in combination with the patient's subjective experiences of care.

          "briefSummary": "The world is currently experiencing a coronavirus (CoV-2) pandemic. A new (SARS)-CoV infection epidemic began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in late 2019; originally called 2019- nCoV the virus is now known as SARSCoV- 2 and the disease it causes COVID-19. Previous CoV epidemics included severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, which started in China in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV in the Middle East, which started in 2012. The mortality rates were \\>10% for SARS and \\>35% for MERS. The direct cause of death is generally due to ensuing severe atypical pneumonia and ensuing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Pneumonia also is generally the cause of death for people who develop influenza, although the mortality rate is lower (1%-3% for the influenza A H5N1 pandemic of 1918-1919 in the United States). Risk factors for a poor outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection have so far been found to include older age and co-morbidities including chronic cardiovascular and respiratory conditions and current smoking status. In May 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 disease based on topline date of two clinical trials, even though an underpowered clinical trial did not find significant improvement in COVID- 19 patients treated with remdesivir. Nevertheless, remdesivir is the first and so far, only approved treatment for COVID-19. Additionally further trials and clinical observations have not found a significant benefit of other antiviral drugs. Although the results of several studies are still pending, there is still a desperate need for an effective, safe treatment for COVID-19. Aviptadil, which is a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), might be beneficial in patients at risk of developing ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it reduces inflammation.",
          "detailedDescription": "About 20% of individuals with Corona Virus disease (COVID-19) experience more severe disease characterized by significant respiratory symptoms including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is a known lethal complication due to its low blood oxygenation levels and may result in organ failure. Until now, there are no specific vaccines or therapeutic drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapeutic interventions are needed to prevent and ameliorate respiratory conditions associated with COVID-19 to effectively reduce mortality and prevent ICU admissions. Aviptadil, which is a synthetic form of Human Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP), might be beneficial in patients at risk of developing ARDS. Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is highly concentrated in the lung, where it prevents N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced caspase-3 activation, inhibits IL-6 and TNFa production and protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema. Further, in animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats, guinea pigs, sheep, swine and dogs, Aviptadil was shown to restore barrier function at the endothelial/alveolar interface and to protect the lung and other organs from failure. In Europe, Aviptadil is approved for human use and has been shown to be safe in phase II trials for sarcoidosis, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchospasm, erectile dysfunction as well as in a phase I trial in ARDS in the past two decades. In the US, VIP has been given FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and was admitted to the FDA Corona Virus Technology Accelerator Program. In a phase I trial of Aviptadil performed by Sami Said in the early 2000s, eight patients with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of intravenous VIP. Seven patients (88%) were successfully extubated and were alive at the five day time point. Six (75%) left the hospital and one (13%) died of an unrelated cardiac event. A phase II clinical trial using intravenous Aviptadil in patients with COVID-19 infection and ARDS has begun. Further, a phase II/III clinical trial will study the effect of inhaled Aviptadil for the treatment of non-acute lung injury in COVID- 19 and begins in June 2020. In Europe, two phase II trials of Aviptadil have been conducted. Further, studies with healthy volunteers have shown that inhaled Aviptadil is well tolerated with few adverse effects."

          "briefSummary": "This study is open to adults 18 years and older with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. People can join the study if they have tumours with HER2 mutations and have not yet received any systemic therapy including chemotherapy for advanced or metastatic lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called zongertinib (BI 1810631) can slow down the worsening of advanced non-small cell lung cancer better than the standard treatment available. Zongertinib may slow cancer cell growth by inhibiting HER2. This would prolong cancer re-occurrence and increase survival. Current standard treatment is pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy.\n\nParticipants are put into 2 groups by chance. One group receives zongertinib at regular times throughout the study and the other group receives infusions of pembrolizumab, pemetrexed and cisplatin or carboplatin (pembrolizumab plus platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy) into a vein.\n\nParticipants may be in the study up to a maximum of 70 months. During this time, they visit the study site about every 3 weeks for study procedures. The doctors regularly check the size of the tumour with a CT or MRI scan, at the beginning of the study and every 6 weeks. After 18 months they check the tumour size every 12 weeks. Doctors regularly check whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. The doctors also regularly check participants' health and take note of any unwanted effects. The time it takes for the cancer to worsen is compared between the 2 groups to see whether the treatment works. The participants also fill in questionnaires about their symptoms and quality of life."

          "briefSummary": "Urinary incontinence is defined by the International Continence Society as \"any involuntary loss of urine complained by the patient\". UI is a debilating condition affecting 25% to 45% of the female population. It is a recognized factor impairing the women's quality of life in women. Age, type and severity of UI as well as stress, fears and beliefs are variables that significantly affect the quality of life scores . Its costs are estimated at 2% of the health budget in European countries. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is characterized by a loss of urine that occurs with increased intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, laughing, sneezing, jumping, running, lifting loads or any other physical activity\n\n. SUI accounts for 50% of UI types. For HAS (Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9), the first-line treatment is a conservative, non-medicinal and non-surgical treatment. Hay Smith's 2010 literature review concludes that pelvic floor muscle rehabilitation (PMP) must be the first-line treatment for SUI. However, there is a lack of evidence to define the best treatment regimen for PFM rehabilitation.\n\nFor 25 years, we have been performing assessment and rehabilitation programs for urinary incontinence. We see daily, as literature suggests, a link between continence and postural control. Previous studies, such as that we carried out within our service, tend to confirm the positive impact of reflex postural control on continence. Our team has already shown the feasibility of such a program and its effectiveness on stress urinary incontinence. Foam surfaces are devices used in the rehabilitation of reflex postural control. Several studies have shown that rehabilitation programs on foam surfaces improve reflex postural control better than the same exercises on stable ground. Smith et al. have shown impaired motor control of MPP on foam surfaces in women with stress urinary incontinence. However, the effect of a rehabilitation program with foam surface on urinary symptoms has never been evaluated.\n\nFor our main outcome, we propose to follow the recommendations of L. Rimstad in his recent prospective study of SUI assessment in 147 subjects aged 36 to 63 years, wich seems more in accordance with postural control disorder than the \"gold standard\" supine cough test wich has been found to have low sensitivity. The test pad on a trampoline allows to object a SUI in 91% of the negative patients to the test pad on firm surface. It therefore makes it possible to object stress urinary incontinence without invasive urodynamic investigations. It therefore seems justified for the comfort of our patients and the relevance of our results. The preliminary assessments and the skills of the physiotherapist make it possible to assess the patient's ability to perform this test. Our experience of carrying out trampoline tests or exercises for 25 years, as of the Rimstad team in the context of the treatment of SUI for 10 years, allows us to carry out this test in good conditions of efficiency , comfort and safety. Thus, we hypothesize that a rehabilitation program by supervised reflex postural control exercises on a foam surface can reduce the volume of urinary leakage in women. This study will also show the influence of such a program on symptoms and quality of life in women with urinary incontinence.\n\nInnovative nature of our study We do not find in the literature any evaluation of the effectiveness of exercises on foam surface on stress urinary incontinence Our protocol, by its minimally invasive nature, would promote a better emotional experience for our patients Most studies in the context of incontinence are based on a semi-objective outcome assessment with symptoms questionnaire. We suggest using the short stress pad test, a more objective test for women, recommended by several authors We will observe the impact of our protocol on pelvic and low back pain, quality of life and any restrictions on social participations We hope to confirm the best acceptance of non-invasive treatments, without intravaginal probe in continence rehabilitation\n\nOur protocol goes in the direction of:\n\n* Literature reviews on urinary incontinence through supervised group sessions\n* WHO's recommendations on the maintenance of balance and physical functions, and also the prevention of falls in adults"

          "briefSummary": "Any time the words \"you,\" \"your,\" \"I,\" or \"me\" appear, it is meant to apply to the potential participant.\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine that can be given by inhalation (breathing it as a mist) to patients with solid tumors that have spread to the lungs from other parts of the body.\n\nThe safety and side effects of this drug will also be studied.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Gemcitabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of pancreatic and lung cancer, and other solid tumors. Its administration by inhalation is investigational. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.\n\nUp to 44 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.",
          "detailedDescription": "Study Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of gemcitabine based on when you join this study. Up to 6 dose levels of gemcitabine will be tested. Up to 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects are seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of gemcitabine is found.\n\nEach study cycle is 28 days. You will take gemcitabine by mist 2 times each week for 4 weeks (28 days). Treatment will be administered at MD Anderson. A machine called a nebulizer will be used to make the gemcitabine mist. The study staff will provide you with protective materials and instructions on how to take the treatment. You will breathe the drug mist through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer. The study staff will tell you which days you will receive the study drug. If the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may continue to receive the study drug for up to 12 cycles.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may continue taking the study drug for up to 12 cycles. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions. If you have developed a tumor outside of the lungs either before or while you are on study, and the doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may have a local control procedure (such as radiation or surgery) that may help to control the disease while continuing to receive the study drug. You would sign a separate consent form explaining these procedures and their risks. If you and your doctor decide on a systemic cancer treatment by mouth or vein, you will no longer be able to receive treatment on this study. A systemic cancer treatment is designed to spread and treat cancer cells throughout the body.\n\nYour participation on the study will be over after your last follow-up phone call.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nWithin 3 days before Day 1 of every cycle:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver function.\n* You will have PFTs.\n* You will have your blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.\n* If you can become pregnant, urine will be collected for a pregnancy test.\n\nOn Day 8 of Cycle 1:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your liver function.\n\nYou will have a CT scan at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6, and then every 3 cycles after that. The study doctor will tell you when you will have these scans. If you have a chest X-ray, MRI, and PET scan as part of standard of care while you are on study, the study doctor may use the results to check the status of the disease.\n\nTo avoid having to come to the study clinic too often, you may have blood draws done by your personal doctor.\n\nYou may be called by the study staff and asked about how you are doing and about any side effects about 1 day after your first 2 doses of the study drug, at the end of Cycle 1, and 1 time every 3 months after that until you leave the study or the study ends. These calls should last about 15-20 minutes each time.\n\nOther Information:\n\nEach day that you take study drug:\n\n* You will write down the date and the day of the study cycle in a dosing diary given to you by the study staff. You should bring the diary to all clinic visits.\n* You will be given a pulse oximeter to measure your heart rate and blood oxygen level. \u00b0You should record your results in the dosing diary.\n* You will use a small hand-held device to test your lung function before the dose and answer questions about side effects you may be having.\n\nYou will also be given an electronic device (such as a laptop or tablet) so that you can upload the information from the lung function tests and send it to the study doctor. You will only be able to access study specific material on this device. The study staff will show you how to use all of the provided machines. If the device is lost, stolen, or damaged, you will need to immediately report it to the study staff and you will be responsible for its replacement.\n\nYou should bring the nebulizer with you to all study visits.\n\nYou will be asked to return the nebulizer, pulse oximeter, lung function device, and electronic device when your participation on this study is over.\n\nEnd of Dosing Visit:\n\nWithin 30 days of your last dose of the study drug:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will have PFTs.\n* You will have your blood oxygen level measured by pulse oximeter.\n* You will have a CT scan."

CURB- 65 was used to measure the confusion, blood urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure for the participants aged greater than or equal to 65 years. Multiple criteria to assess the severity of CAP exist. In this study severity was first globally assessed asking if a (any) criterion for severity of CAP would apply.

          "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose, Phase 1/2a multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, viral shedding, immunogenicity, and genotypic and phenotypic stability of MEDI-559 in RSV seronegative infants 5 to \\<24 months of age and in infants 1 to \\<3 months of age regardless of baseline serostatus. The primary objective of this study is to describe the 28-day post-final dose safety and tolerability of three doses of MEDI-559 at 10\\^5 FFU when administered to healthy RSV seronegative children 5 to \\<24 months of age and to healthy infants 1 to \\<3 months of age regardless of baseline serostatus.\n\nMEDI-559 will be administered at a dose of 10\\^5 fluorescent focus units (FFU) on a 0, 2, and 4 month schedule to two cohorts of subjects in a step-wise fashion. The target sample size for this study is 320 subjects, with 160 subjects 5 to \\<24 months of age enrolled into Cohort 1 and 160 subjects 1 to \\<3 months of age enrolled into Cohort 2. Each cohort will be randomized 1:1 (MEDI-559 to placebo) and stratified by site. Cohort 1 will initiate dosing at 10\\^5 FFU MEDI-559. Blinded safety data from the first 40 subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 for the 28 days following administration of the first dose of vaccine will be reviewed. If no safety concerns are noted, Cohort 2 will initiate dosing at 10\\^5 FFU. Enrollment into Cohort 2 will be halted after approximately 40 subjects have been randomized, and blinded safety data will be reviewed through 28 days post Dose 1. If no safety concerns are noted, the remainder of Cohort 2 will be enrolled. All subjects will be followed through 365 days after randomization to ensure that each subject has been followed through an RSV season."

In this study, individuals living with COPD will participate in an online exercise intervention. The exercises included in this intervention are based in individuals' activities of daily living. Additionally, during this intervention, individuals with COPD will participate in peer support sessions and will be taught and encouraged to discuss eight behaviour change techniques that have been shown to help support increased participation in physical activity and/or exercise. The goal of this study is to test out this new protocol and determine if it is feasible to recreate on a larger scale and if it is acceptable for the COPD community."

          "briefSummary": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD for short) involves inflammation inside the air passages of the lungs. This inflammation might be partly responsible for the shortness of breath, cough and susceptibility to chest infections that form part of COPD. Inflammation is caused, in part, by white blood cells that are attracted from the blood into the air passages. Once inside the air passages, the white blood cells may change (or 'differentiate') and release substances that produce inflammation and attract more white cells. The hypothesis is that the lifespan of these cells may also be prolonged such that they produce more inflammatory mediators and in turn perpetuate inflammation. The cycle of inflammation may damage the lungs, so we want to see what mediators are released by white blood cells and determine if we can inhibit this effect with existing and new drugs. We would also like to see the effect of these drugs on the life-span and function of white blood cells. We will compare the behaviour and characteristics of white cells with those from healthy smokers and healthy non-smokers to find out if there is anything different about cells from COPD patients.",
          "detailedDescription": "The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the survival of blood leukocytes as well as the synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators from cells from normal individuals and subjects with COPD. The hypothesis is that in COPD the life-span of leukocytes, such as the neutrophil, is enhanced and this may contribute to inflammation, a prominent characteristic of this disease, by secreting and releasing inflammatory mediators. We also suggest that differences may exist in the sensitivity of the various leukocytes to different therapies.\n\nLeukocytes will be purified from the peripheral venous blood of patients with COPD as well as healthy individuals. We will then investigate the effects of novel and existing therapeutic agents on leukocyte survival and inflammatory mediator synthesis and release. We will also examine the regulation and release of enzymes known to damage lung tissue. Further studies will be carried out to elucidate the signal transduction pathways that lead to the activation, altered longevity and function of leukocytes. In other experiments ribonucleic acids or RNA may be extracted form leukocytes to investigate which genes are involved. The primary objective is to identify the mechanisms that enhance leukocyte longevity and inflammatory mediator and/or enzyme synthesis and release with a view to identifying novel targets for drug therapy."

          "briefSummary": "Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy is a method increasingly used for prostate cancer due to fewer complications, morbidity, and mortality compared to other methods. The technique involves inflating the abdomen with carbon dioxide to provide visualization and working in a steep Trendelenburg position, which puts pressure on the lungs and can cause them to collapse. The functional residual capacity reduction caused by general anesthesia, combined with the negative effects of the position, increases the risk of significant respiratory system complications during and after surgery.\n\nLung protective ventilation strategies can reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) by alleviating iatrogenic injury to previously healthy lungs. Apart from a low tidal volume (VT), applying positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can minimize the risk of atelectasis and/or overdistension.\n\nThere is limited information on how to adjust optimal PEEP under increased intra-abdominal pressure during laparoscopy. A meta-analysis study on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients showed that high driving pressure (plateau pressure - PEEP) is the most associated value with mortality. It was shown that VT, plateau pressure, and PEEP are not related to patient outcomes or only when they affect driving pressure. Subsequent retrospective and prospective studies confirmed the importance of driving pressure in ARDS patients and surgical patients.\n\nFor patients under mechanical ventilation, applying a personalized PEEP that provides the lowest driving pressure, along with maneuvers to open closed alveoli (recruitment), reduces respiratory system complications during and after surgery. One method to visualize the effects of these maneuvers and the ideal PEEP application, which provides the lowest driving pressure for the patient, is electrical impedance tomography (EIT), a non-invasive, radiation-free bedside imaging technique.\n\nEIT, measured with 16 electrodes placed on an elastic belt around the patient\\&amp;amp;#39;s 4th to 6th ribs, shows impedance changes in the lungs. This method successfully visualizes and evaluates dynamic changes in gas distribution within the lungs and has been validated by computed tomography scans, proving safe for use in both adults and pediatric patients. EIT divides the lungs into four layers from ventral to dorsal, showing the percentage distribution of tidal volume in these regions. Examining the relative impedance changes allows for observing gas volume distribution entering the lungs and evaluating regional lung characteristics.\n\nTherefore, EIT can contribute to examining the PEEP value that ensures homogeneous gas distribution in the lungs and preventing ventilator-associated lung injury.\n\nThe aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of driving pressure guided mechanical ventilation on lung gas distribution during robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy through respiratory parameters recorded by EIT during surgery and perioperative period and to compare perioperative pulmonary complications with traditional ventilation methods",
          "detailedDescription": "General anesthesia increases the risk of respiratory complications and impairs arterial oxygenation by causing atelectasis in the dorsal regions of the lungs. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) represent events such as atelectasis, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, pleuritis, reintubation, and the need for oxygen support after surgery, and are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, intensive care, and hospital stay durations, as well as higher healthcare costs. The effective strategy to reduce the incidence of PPC in patients under general anesthesia is still not clear.\n\nRobot-assisted surgeries are increasingly preferred for prostatectomy, a curative treatment for prostate cancer, due to advantages such as less blood loss, less scar tissue formation, and shorter hospital stays compared to other surgical methods. During robotic surgery, many factors such as laparoscopy, pneumoperitoneum, and extreme Trendelenburg position can negatively affect lung function. Studies have shown that high driving pressure values, resulting from the set tidal volume target and PEEP values during mechanical ventilation, increase postoperative pulmonary complications.\n\nDeveloping mechanical ventilation strategies based on personalized PEEP values that provide the lowest driving pressure after recruitment maneuvers to include closed alveoli in respiration and monitoring the effects of this method on the lungs during the perioperative period using electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a highly useful tool. EIT, a non-invasive, radiation-free bedside monitoring system that detects real-time regional ventilation changes, can be used to guide individualized protective ventilation strategies to reduce perioperative respiratory system complications. Examining ROI values measured by EIT shows the effect of ventilation strategies on the distribution of tidal volume in the lungs. ROIs calculated by selecting layers, with ROI 1 and ROI 2 reflecting the ventral parts and ROI 3 and ROI 4 reflecting the dorsal parts, can be used to demonstrate the effect of the chosen ventilation strategy on lung gas distribution through intergroup comparison.\n\nThe age, gender, height, weight, body mass index, diagnosis, ASA score, preoperative hemoglobin level, additional systemic diseases, smoking history, prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, and prostate volume of the patients will be recorded. All patients will be monitored with electrocardiogram (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), invasive arterial pressure (systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and mean arterial pressure), and electrical impedance tomography. Patients will be prospectively randomized into two groups; group assignments will be determined using a closed-envelope technique.\n\nAll patients will be preoxygenated with 80% FiO2, followed by induction of anesthesia with 2 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, and 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium. After orotracheal intubation, patients will be placed on mechanical ventilation in volume control-autoflow mode with 8 ml/kg tidal volume, 2 L/min fresh gas flow, 0.4 inspired fractional oxygen (FiO2), an inspiratory: expiratory ratio of 1:2, and a respiratory rate to achieve normocapnia (partial carbon dioxide pressure PaCO2: 35-45 mmHg). Recruitment maneuvers will be applied to all patients.\n\nDuring the recruitment maneuver: with an inspiratory: expiratory ratio of 1:1, a respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg will be applied for 1 minute at a PEEP level of 5 cmH2O. This will be followed by ventilation with a tidal volume of 10 ml/kg for 1 minute at 10 cmH2O PEEP, and finally, ventilation with a tidal volume of 12 ml/kg for 1 minute at 15 cmH2O PEEP.The mechanical ventilation strategies for the patients will be planned according to their group.\n\nFor all patients, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and SpO2 values will be recorded before induction, after intubation, at 5-minute intervals for up to 60 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position, at 60 minutes after Trendelenburg position , at 75 minutes after Trendelenburg position , at 90 minutes after Trendelenburg position, at 120 minutes after Trendelenburg position, at 180 minutes after Trendelenburg position, at 240 minutes after Trendelenburg position, before extubation, 5 minutes after extubation , at 60 minutes postoperatively , at 24 hours postoperatively , and at 48 hours postoperatively . Additionally, while the patient is on mechanical ventilation, peak pressure, plateau pressure, PEEP, mean airway pressure (MPaw), compliance, and end-tidal carbon dioxide values will also be recorded.\n\nIntermittent arterial blood gas analysis with invasive arterial monitoring is a routine practice in our daily practice. Arterial blood gas analysis will be performed preoperatively, immediately after intubation, at 15, 60, and 120 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position, immediately before extubation, and 5 minutes after extubation, with pH, partial oxygen pressure (pO2), partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2), oxygenation index (pO2/FiO2), bicarbonate, lactate, and hemoglobin values recorded.\n\nAnesthesia duration, perioperative fluid volume, perioperative blood loss and urine output, operation duration, pneumoperitoneum duration, mechanical ventilation duration, and vasoactive agent use duration will be recorded.\n\nIn all patients, ROI values measured by electrical impedance tomography, which we use routinely in our daily practice, will be recorded before intubation, immediately after intubation, at 15, 60, and 120 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position, immediately before extubation in the supine position, and 5 minutes after extubation.\n\nPostoperative pulmonary complications in patients will be monitored using SpO2, fever, cough, and sputum history, as well as prolonged intubation if present, and the duration of oxygen support and the development of additional pathology will be recorded."

The principal bacterial pathogens in causing ABRS include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. These three bacteria account for approximately 90% of ABRS in children less than or equal to 5 years of age. Combination of Potassium Clavulanate (CVA) and Amoxicillin (AMPC) produces higher antibiotic activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The present study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and safety of CVA/AMPC (1:14) administered in children aged from 3 months to less than 15 years with ABRS. It is an open-label study consisting of a 7-day treatment phase and a post-treatment follow-up phase for 7 to 14 days."

Awake tracheal intubation which is used to retain spontaneous breathing is one of the important measures to ensure the safety of the patients with difficult airway in anesthesia.\n\nSufentanil is used to provide good analgesia and can effectively inhibit the reaction of awake tracheal intubation, however, the outstanding problem is serious respiratory depression after intravenous sufentanil injection. Few study showed that dezocine is a kappa opioid antagonist related to mild respiratory depression and can prevents sufentanil-induced cough during general anesthesia induction.It is necessary to carry out large-scale, multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical study to determine whether dezocine prevents sufentanil-induced respiratory depression and whether dezocine combined sufentanil is a safe and effective method for awake tracheal intubation."

          "briefSummary": "Protocol Title\n\nA Study to Evaluate ANS014004 in Combination with EGFR-TKI in Patients with EGFR Mutation-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\n\nThe main purpose of this research study is to\n\nFind a safe and tolerable dose of two investigational drugs, ANS014004 and PLB1004, when used together.\n\nLearn how effective this drug combination is at treating a type of lung cancer called \"EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)\" that has spread to other parts of the body (locally advanced or metastatic).\n\nThis study is trying to answer the following questions:\n\nSafety \\& Dosing: What are the side effects of combining ANS014004 and PLB1004? What is the best dose to use that patients can tolerate well?\n\nEffectiveness: Can this combination of drugs help shrink patients' tumors or stop them from growing?\n\nBackground Information\n\nFor patients with advanced lung cancer that has a specific gene change called an \"EGFR mutation,\" targeted therapies known as EGFR-TKIs are a standard treatment. While these treatments often work well at first, most tumors eventually stop responding to the drug (this is called \"acquired resistance\"). The investigational drug ANS014004 is designed to block a protein called MET, which is one of the ways that tumors become resistant to EGFR-TKIs. The researchers believe that by combining ANS014004 with the EGFR-TKI PLB1004, they may be able to prevent or delay resistance, offering patients a more effective and longer-lasting treatment option.\n\nHow will the study be conducted?\n\nThis study is divided into two parts:\n\nPart 1 (Dose Escalation and Optimization): A small number of participants will receive different dose levels of ANS014004 combined with a fixed dose of PLB1004. The goal is to find the safest and most tolerable dose combination.\n\nPart 2 (Phase II Study): Once a recommended dose is identified, more participants will be enrolled to further evaluate how well the drug combination works against the cancer.\n\nThroughout the study, participants' health will be closely monitored, and their tumors will be measured regularly using imaging scans (like CT scans) to see how they respond to the treatment."

          "briefSummary": "To find out whether oral antibiotics given after transsphenoidal endoscopic surgery for pituitary adenoma improves sinus and nasal symptoms, reduces the incidence of infection (sinusitis), and helps mucosal healing in the nasal passages.",
          "detailedDescription": "Transsphenoidal surgery is the standard of care for most symptomatic pituitary adenomas. Since transsphenoidal surgery exploits the nasal passage to reach the sella turcica and pituitary gland, the technique causes disruption of sinonasal function and temporarily impacts sinonasal quality of life. Disrupted sinonasal function is a primary source of postoperative morbidity following transsphenoidal surgery. Common sinonasal complications include sinusitis, synechiae formation, nasal obstruction and crusting. The development of postoperative sinusitis is specifically associated with decreased sinonasal function after surgery. Because the nasal cavity is a contaminated surgical field, practitioners routinely prescribe a course of oral postoperative antibiotics for 7-14 days (in addition to standard prophylactic perioperative intravenous antibiotics) with the intention of improving nasal functional outcomes. To date, no studies have examined whether the administration of oral antibiotics following transsphenoidal surgery improves sinonasal healing. This question has been studied in a closely-related field, functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). A meta-analysis of clinical trial data obtained in FESS indicated that current literature does not support the use of oral antibiotics to reduce infection, improve symptoms scores, or improve endoscopic findings. Furthermore, there is the potential for antibiotic-related adverse events including the emergence of bacterial resistance, Clostridium difficile infection, and allergic reactions to the medication. Despite the lack of supporting evidence in FESS, prophylactic antibiotic use for improving sinonasal healing is still common in pituitary surgery. The investigators propose to study whether prophylactic oral antibiotics following transsphenoidal surgery improve sinonasal quality of life, reduce sinusitis incidence, and promote mucosal healing following endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery."

          "briefSummary": "The ACCREDIT study - Acute respiratory infections and chronic respiratory disease exacerbations characterisation and personalised treatment platform study 2 (AcCREDiT 2).\n\nPatients with respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) or exacerbations of chronic respiratory conditions (such as emphysema) often require hospital admission. Infections or exacerbation are commonly caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi. In at least a quarter of patients no infectious cause of the exacerbation is found. Depending on the cause of the respiratory infections or exacerbations of chronic respiratory condition patients require prompt treatment with anti-infective drugs (antibiotics, anti-fungal or antiviral drugs) or anti-inflammatory drugs such as corticosteroids.\n\nPatients with respiratory infection or exacerbations of chronic respiratory conditions develop symptoms such as cough, sometimes with sputum, fever or breathlessness. These symptoms can be similar across several conditions, many of which are not due to infection (for example heart failure or blood clots in the lungs). When assessing patients with respiratory symptoms, clinicians face the challenge of limited information in the early stages of care as it takes three days to identify infectious organisms in the laboratory. Even when an infection is strongly suspected, distinguishing bacterial from viral or fungal infections on clinical grounds alone is difficult. This uncertainty often leads clinicians to prescribe a number of treatments, including antibiotics, before a clear diagnosis is made. Timely treatment is crucial for success and improved patient outcomes, especially for critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, antibiotics may cause side effects, such as sickness and diarrhoea, and overuse of antibiotics leads to antibiotic resistance, making antibiotics less effective when they are really needed. Giving antibiotics to patients with an infection or exacerbation and avoiding antibiotics in patients without an infection requires rapid diagnostic tests. Furthermore, giving antibiotics prior to taking samples to diagnose infection can affect the sample being tested making it more likely to not give a useful result. For a diagnostic test for infection to be most useful it needs to be collected before an antibiotic is given - this is true for both clinical tests and those research tests which are clinical tests in development.\n\nModern technologies allow testing for an infection in hours rather than days. In order to understand how effective these technologies are, samples need to be taken from patients before they start treatment. In routine NHS care samples to test for infection should be taken before treatment has been started. However, in research studies samples are often taken up to a day after treatment has started which affects how effective the test is at finding infection. The forerunner to this study, called AcCREDiT, proposed investigating very rapid ways of identifying individuals with respiratory infection and exacerbation. However, the study team encountered challenges during the informed consent process, particularly with acutely unwell patients. Therefore, the AcCREDiT-2 was designed in collaboration with patients and public contributors to look at the feasibility of a modified informed consent process: verbal consent, assent for individuals with capacity to consent for themselves, and deferred consent.\n\nAcCREDiT-2 will be an observational study, meaning that no treatment will be changed, and no experimental drugs or tests used to influence the clinical care of participants. AcCREDiT-2 will also be a 'feasibility study', which is a smaller study designed to see what works well before embarking on a larger project. During the study the investigators will collect clinical information and samples, such as blood, sputum and stool, from patients who come to hospital with a presumed respiratory infection or exacerbation of their chronic respiratory condition. The investigators will compare new diagnostic tests to traditional laboratory tests to understand their relative advantages and disadvantages for patient care.\n\nThis is a 'feasibility' study, a small study ran first to make sure things work properly before expanding to a much larger study."
